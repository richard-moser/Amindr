(F) NOT RELEVANT
We are interested in peer-reviewed publications of primary research articles or 5b-analyses that help us understand the pathology and progression of AD, diagnose it, prevent it, or develop treatments against it. If the publication does not fulfill these criteria, please classify it as NOT RELEVENT. Not relevant are publications on treatments non-specific to AD, on patient care, quality of life and caregivers (except papers that mention quality of life as an outcome of a treatment), papers that only mention AD in the dataset name and papers that focus on other neurodegenerative diseases: PD, FTD etc., with little comparison to AD.
(A) Disease Mechanisms
The goal of this topic is to better understand how AD develops and progresses. This includes papers that aim to understand the genetics, neuropathology, and cellular/molecular mechanisms underlying Alzheimerâ€™s disease and its progression. It can include in silico papers (modelling protein folding/binding), preclinical papers (in vitro/animal models), clinical studies looking at neuropathology (topography, associations, etc.), and development of new methods or models (animal or in vitro) for studying AD. The paper should not be directly related to treatment (except of concluding sentences may say that the work gives insight into new treatment avenues), in which case it would fall under category C, or measures of disease status or progression, in which case it would fall under category C. 
(C) Diagnostic/Prognostic Tools
The goal of this topic is to diagnose or stratify patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or distinguish them from other diseases. This includes papers focused on using tools for prognosis (looking at disease trajectory or progression from MCI to AD), or diagnosis (differentiating AD from other neurodegenerative diseases, or AD from cognitively normal controls/MCI) of AD/MCI. It also includes papers that seem focused on a different neurodegenerative disease, but provide insight into how AD may be distinct (Dementia with Lewy Bodies, Vascular Dementia), papers focused on diagnostic tools for MCI/subjective MCI and papers on post-mortem studies if they fit the other criteria.
(D) Treatment Avenues
The goal of this topic is to treat or prevent AD

(A1) Genetics 
This topic includes new variants, genetic and transcriptomics insights, APOE, and familial AD mutations.
(A2) Autophagy/Proteostasis
This topic includes endosomal/lysosomal dysfunction, protein uptake/trafficking, mitophagy, general protein aggregation, post-translational modifications, and proteomics. It does not include tau and amyloid-beta, as it belongs to a different topic.
(A3) Metabolism and Mitochondrial Dysfunction/Oxidative Stress
This topic is about metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction/oxidative stress
(A4) Neural Excitability, Synapses, and Brain Connectivity
This topic includes synaptic transmission and neurotransmitters, and brain connectivity (functional) and structural integrity.
(A5) Amyloid Pathology
This topic includes APP processing/secretases, amyloid-beta aggregation, and amyloid-beta function and amyloid-mediated toxicity/pathology.
(A6) Tau Pathology
This topic includes tau post-translational modifications/aggregations, and tau seeding and pathology.
(A7) The Immune System and Glial Cells
This topic includes the gut/brain axis, peripheral and neuroinflammation, TREM2, astrocyte/microglia focused papers, and oligodendrocyte papers.
(A8) Cognitive and Behavioural Changes
This topic focuses on cognitive and behavioral changes. It includes depression, sleep, smell, and auditory/visual processing. 
(A9) Vascular Contributions
This topic includes arterial stiffness, atherosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, microbleeds, white matter hyperintensities, blood-brain barrier, endothelial cells, lipoproteins interacting with vessels, angiogenesis, and platelet aggregation.
(A10) Epidemiological Studies 
This topic includes non-genetic factors or comorbidities that put people at risk of developing AD or decrease the risk. It includes incidence/prevalence studies in specific populations, genetic predisposition to a risk factor, comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease/diabetes/depression, nutrition/vitamin deficiencies, socioeconomic background, air pollution, etc. Note: Mechanistic studies relating to HOW these non-genetic factors/comorbidities put people at risk belong to the other categories depending on their fit.
