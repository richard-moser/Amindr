Antiamyloid antibodies have been used to reduce cerebral amyloid-beta (Aβ) load 
in patients with Alzheimer's disease. We applied focused ultrasound with each of 
six monthly aducanumab infusions to temporarily open the blood-brain barrier 
with the goal of enhancing amyloid removal in selected brain regions in three 
participants over a period of 6 months. The reduction in the level of Aβ was 
numerically greater in regions treated with focused ultrasound than in the 
homologous regions in the contralateral hemisphere that were not treated with 
focused ultrasound, as measured by fluorine-18 florbetaben positron-emission 
tomography. Cognitive tests and safety evaluations were conducted over a period 
of 30 to 180 days after treatment. (Funded by the Harry T. Mangurian, Jr.

Memory loss is a common complaint among older adults, and cognitive decline can 
present in various ways. It is a part of the normal aging process, subjective 
cognitive impairment (symptomatic complaints with normal neurocognitive test 
results), mild cognitive impairment, or dementia. Although mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) has been used in the literature since the 1960s, it was first 
fully characterized in 1997 by Petersen and colleagues at the Mayo Clinic. As 
part of their community aging study, they observed individuals with memory 
concerns beyond what was expected for their age. They demonstrated memory 
impairment on objective testing yet did not fulfill the criteria for 
dementia. MCI was deemed to represent a borderline between normal aging and very 
early dementia. The earlier criteria for MCI diagnosis were found inadequate 
when it was realized that not all patients with MCI progressed to dementia and 
that memory impairment was not the only cognitive domain affected. Thus, a 
broader definition of MCI was needed. In 2003, the first Key Symposium on MCI 
was held, leading to the publication of revised core clinical criteria. These 
criteria included cognitive complaints from the patient or family members, 
deficits in any cognitive domain and not only memory, preserved overall general 
function but increasing difficulties in activities of daily life, and no 
dementia. The concept of MCI traveled outside the realm of research to provide 
clinicians with a useful diagnosis, often for close monitoring. Further clinical 
research resulted in the development of novel clinical criteria for providers.  
The American Psychiatry Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders 5th Edition (DSM-V) in 2013 classified MCI as one of the 
neurocognitive disorders (NCD). It is characterized by a decline in one or more 
cognitive domains, which is both subjectively and objectively observable. 
However, this decline does not interfere with the individual's ability to 
perform daily activities independently. Moreover, the deficits cannot be 
attributed to delirium or other psychiatric conditions. DSM-V does not propose 
specific neuropsychology test scores for diagnosing mild NCD. However, it is 
implied that such scores would help make this diagnosis. After diagnosing the 
syndrome as mild NCD, the next step is determining the etiology. The 11th 
Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD 11) by the World 
Health Organization (WHO) in 2018 adopted the definition of mild neurocognitive 
disorder in alignment with the DSM-V diagnostic criteria. The National Institute 
on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) convened a work group to 
discuss the MCI criteria. The group proposed metrics for the distinct definition 
of MCI due to Alzheimer Disease. The initial criteria were published in 2011 and 
revised in 2018. The initial criteria closely resemble the core clinical 
criteria proposed by the 2003 Symposium. The 2018 revision noted that 
neurobehavioral disturbance may be an important feature of the clinical 
presentation and that cognitive deficits may result in a mild but noticeable 
impact on the complex activities of daily living. The NIA-AA also suggested 
research criteria for MCI due to AD in 2011 to help determine the etiology of 
MCI established by the core clinical criteria. These included the use of 
biomarkers to differentiate MCI due to AD from MCI due to other reasons. The 
biomarkers are not used to define MCI but can be helpful in research settings. 
The two main helpful biomarkers are amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition and neuronal 
injury. MCI can also be classified based on the type of cognitive domain that is 
affected. MCI can potentially affect one or more of the following 6 cognitive 
domains: learning and memory, language, complex attention, executive function, 
social cognition, and visuospatial function. MCI can be classified as "amnestic" 
or "non-amnestic" with deficits in single or multiple cognitive domains. 
Amnestic MCI presents with predominant memory loss and the risk for progression 
to Alzheimer's Disease. In non-amnestic MCI, memory is relatively intact, and it 
is less common than the amnestic type and may progress to non-Alzheimer disease 
dementia. MCI can be further categorized into 4 subtypes:  In 2009, a 
comprehensive Neuropsychology classification system was introduced as the 
dichotomous classification was considered inadequate to represent the 
heterogeneous nature of MCI. These MCI classes are: : 1. Amnestic - impaired 
recall and recognition . 2. Mixed - impairments in various domains such as 
language, executive function, recall and recognition, and visuospatial 
functioning. 3. Dysexecutive - impairments in attention, executive, and 
visuospatial functions, but the memory remains intact. . 4. Visuospatial - 
impairment in only a single measure of visual construction. . The phenotypic 
classification of MCI with clinical information and laboratory tests can guide 
the clinician in determining the probable cause of MCI and predicting its 
course. Patients with dysexecutive MCI (dMCI) are less likely to have Alzheimer 
- type dementia and more likely to have a stroke.

Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation contributes to acute demyelination in 
neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD). Soluble triggering receptor 
expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2) in the CSF has been associated with 
microglial activation in several neurodegenerative diseases. However, the basis 
for this immune-mediated attack and the pathophysiological role of sTREM2 in 
NMOSD remain to be elucidated. Here, we performed Mendelian randomization 
analysis and identified a genetic association between increased CSF sTREM2 and 
NMOSD risk. CSF sTREM2 was elevated in patients with NMOSD and was positively 
correlated with neural injury and other neuroinflammation markers. Single-cell 
RNA sequencing of human macrophage/microglia-like cells in CSF, a proxy for 
microglia, showed that increased CSF sTREM2 was positively associated with 
microglial dysfunction in patients with NMOSD. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 
sTREM2 is a reliable biomarker of microglial activation in a mouse model of 
NMOSD. Using unbiased transcriptomic and lipidomic screens, we identified that 
excessive activation, overwhelmed phagocytosis of myelin debris, suppressed 
lipid metabolism and enhanced glycolysis underlie sTREM2-mediated microglial 
dysfunction, possibly through the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signalling 
pathway. These molecular and cellular findings provide a mechanistic explanation 
for the genetic association between CSF sTREM2 and NMOSD risk and indicate that 
sTREM2 could be a potential biomarker of NMOSD progression and a therapeutic 
target for microglia-mediated neuroinflammation.

Neurotrophins (NGF, BDNF, NT3, NT4) can decrease cell death, induce 
differentiation, as well as sustain the structure and function of neurons, which 
make them promising therapeutic agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative 
disorders. However, neurotrophins have not been very effective in clinical 
trials mostly because they cannot pass through the blood-brain barrier owing to 
being high-molecular-weight proteins. Thus, neurotrophin-mimic small molecules, 
which stimulate the synthesis of endogenous neurotrophins or enhance 
neurotrophic actions, may serve as promising alternatives to neurotrophins. 
Small-molecular-weight natural products, which have been used in dietary 
functional foods or in traditional medicines over the course of human history, 
have a great potential for the development of new therapeutic agents against 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. In this contribution, a 
variety of natural products possessing neurotrophic properties such as 
neurogenesis, neurite outgrowth promotion (neuritogenesis), and neuroprotection 
are described, and a focus is made on the chemistry and biology of several 
neurotrophic natural products.

BACKGROUND: Some studies have shown that gut microbiota may be associated with 
dementia. However, the causal effects between gut microbiota and different types 
of dementia and whether cytokines act as a mediator remain unclear.
METHODS: Gut microbiota, cytokines, and five dementia types, including 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia with Lewy body 
(DLB), vascular dementia (VD), and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) were 
identified from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary data. 
We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causal relationships 
between gut microbiota, cytokines, and five types of dementia. Inverse variance 
weighting (IVW) was used as the main statistical method. In addition, we 
explored whether cytokines act as a mediating factor in the pathway from gut 
microbiota to dementia.
RESULTS: There were 20 positive and 16 negative causal effects between genetic 
liability in the gut microbiota and dementia. Also, there were five positive and 
four negative causal effects between cytokines and dementias. Cytokines did not 
act as mediating factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Gut microbiota and cytokines were causally associated with five 
types of dementia, and cytokines seemed not to be the mediating factors in the 
pathway from gut microbiota to dementia.

Differential diagnosis between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebral amyloid 
angiopathy (CAA) using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers is challenging. A 
recent study suggested that the addition of Aβ38 and Aβ43 to a standard AD 
biomarker panel (Aβ40, Aβ42, t-tau, p-tau) to improve the differential 
diagnosis. We tested this hypothesis in an independent German cohort of CAA and 
AD patients and controls using the same analytical techniques. We found 
excellent discrimination between AD and controls and between CAA and controls, 
but not between AD and CAA. Adding Aβ38 and Aβ43 to the panel did not improve 
the discrimination between AD and CAA.

IMPORTANCE: Parkinson disease and related disorders (PDRD) are the fastest 
growing neurodegenerative illness in terms of prevalence and mortality. As 
evidence builds to support palliative care (PC) for PDRD, studies are needed to 
guide implementation.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether PC training for neurologists and remote access 
to a PC team improves outcomes in patients with PDRD in community settings.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This pragmatic, stepped-wedge comparative 
effectiveness trial enrolled and observed participants from 19 community 
neurology practices supported by PC teams at 2 academic centers from March 8, 
2017, to December 31, 2020. Participants were eligible if they had PDRD and 
moderate to high PC needs. A total of 612 persons with PDRD were referred; 253 
were excluded. Patients were excluded if they had another diagnosis meriting PC, 
were receiving PC, or were unable or unwilling to follow study procedures. 
Patients received usual care or the intervention based on when their community 
neurologist was randomized to start the intervention. Data were analyzed from 
January 2021 to September 2023.
INTERVENTION: The intervention included (1) PC education for community 
neurologists and (2) team-based PC support via telehealth.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were differences at 6 months in 
patient quality of life (QOL; measured by the Quality of Life in Alzheimer 
Disease Scale [QOL-AD]) and caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Interview) between 
the intervention and usual care.
RESULTS: A total of 359 patients with PDRD (233 men [64.9%]; mean [SD] age, 74.0 
[8.8] years) and 300 caregivers were enrolled. At 6 months, compared with usual 
care, participants receiving the intervention had better QOL (QOL-AD score, 0.09 
[95% CI, -0.63 to 0.82] vs -0.88 [95% CI, -1.62 to -0.13]; treatment effect 
estimate, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.07-1.86; P = .03). No significant difference was 
observed in caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Interview score, 1.19 [95% CI, 0.16 
to 2.23] vs 0.55 [95%, -0.44 to 1.54]; treatment effect estimate, 0.64; 95% CI, 
-0.62 to 1.90; P = .32). Advance directive completion was higher under the 
intervention (19 of 38 [50%] vs 6 of 31 [19%] among those without directives at 
the beginning of the study; P = .008). There were no differences in other 
outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: PC education for community neurologists and provision 
of team-based PC via telehealth is feasible and may improve QOL and advance care 
planning. Overall treatment effects were small and suggest opportunities to 
improve both the intervention and implementation.

Alzheimer's disease is a multi-factorial disease that disrupts many aspects of 
human behavior. In this comment, we highlight the work by Koulousakis et al. 
published in a recent issue of the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease. In this 
study, the authors tested the therapeutic potential of the neuropeptide oxytocin 
in a pre-clinical model of Alzheimer's disease and found positive behavioral 
outcomes on memory assessments. We discuss these findings in the context of 
oxytocin research in the field of Alzheimer's disease and the literature 
regarding oxytocin-based therapeutics, including administration protocols and 
potential underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms.

In the central nervous system, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 
(TREM2) is exclusively expressed by microglia and is critical for microglial 
proliferation, migration, and phagocytosis. TREM2 plays an important role in 
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis. However, little is known about the role TREM2 plays in 
epileptogenesis. To investigate this, we utilized TREM2 knockout (KO) mice 
within the murine intra-amygdala kainic acid seizure model. 
Electroencephalographic analysis, immunocytochemistry, and RNA sequencing 
revealed that TREM2 deficiency significantly promoted seizure-induced pathology. 
We found that TREM2 KO increased both acute status epilepticus and spontaneous 
recurrent seizures characteristic of chronic focal epilepsy. Mechanistically, 
phagocytic clearance of damaged neurons by microglia was impaired in TREM2 KO 
mice and the reduced phagocytic capacity correlated with increased spontaneous 
seizures. Analysis of human tissue from patients who underwent surgical 
resection for drug resistant temporal lobe epilepsy also showed a negative 
correlation between microglial phagocytic activity and focal to bilateral 
tonic-clonic generalized seizure history. These results indicate that microglial 
TREM2 and phagocytic activity may be important to epileptogenesis and the 
progression of focal temporal lobe epilepsy.

A "chemical tongue" is proposed based on thiomalic acid-capped quantum dots 
(QDs) with signal enrichment provided by excitation-emission matrix (EEM) 
fluorescence spectroscopy for the determination of close structural 
analogs-short-length amyloid β (Aβ) peptides related to Alzheimer's disease. 
Excellent discrimination is obtained by principal component analysis (PCA) for 
seven derivatives: Aβ1-16, Aβ4-16, Aβ4-9, Aβ5-16, Aβ5-12, Aβ5-9, Aβ12-16. 
Detection of Aβ4-16, Aβ4-16, and Aβ5-9 in binary and ternary mixtures performed 
by QDs-based chemical tongue using partial least squares-discriminant analysis 
(PLS-DA) provided perfect 100% accuracy for the two studied peptides (Aβ4-16 and 
Aβ4-16), while for the third one (Aβ5-9) it was slightly lower (97.9%). 
Successful detection of Aβ4-16 at 1 pmol/mL (1.6 ng/mL) suggests that the 
detection limit of the proposed method for short-length Aβ peptides can span 
nanomolar concentrations. This result is highly promising for the development of 
simple and efficient methods for sequence recognition in short-length peptides 
and better understanding of mechanisms at the QD-analyte interface.

BACKGROUND: Aging is considered a key risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
This study aimed to identify and validate potential aging-related genes 
associated with AD using bioinformatics analysis.
METHODS: Datasets GSE36980 and GSE5281 were selected to screen differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs), and the immune cell correlation analysis and GSEA 
analysis of DEGs were performed. The intersection with senescence genes was 
taken as differentially expressed senescence-related genes (DESRGs), and the 
GSE44770 dataset was used for further validation. The potential biological 
functions and signaling pathways were determined by GO and KEGG, and the hub 
genes were identified by 12 algorithms in Cytohubba. The expression of 10 hub 
genes in different brain regions was determined and single-cell sequencing 
analysis was performed, and diagnostic genes were further screened by gene 
expression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Finally, a 
miRNA-gene network of diagnostic genes was constructed and targeted drug 
prediction was performed.
RESULTS: A total of 2137 DEGs were screened from the GSE36980 and GSE5281 
datasets, and 278 SRGs were identified from the CellAge database. The 
overlapping DEGs and SRGs constituted 29 DESRGs, including 14 senescence 
suppressor genes and 15 senescence inducible genes. The top 10 hub genes, 
including MDH1, CKB, PSMD14, SMARCA4, PEBP1, DDB2, ITPKB, ATF7IP, YAP1, and 
EWSR1 were screened. Furthermore, four diagnostic genes were identified: PMSD14, 
PEBP1, ITPKB, and ATF7IP. The ROC analysis showed that the respective area under 
the curves (AUCs) of PMSD14, PEBP1, ITPKB, and ATF7IP were 0.732, 0.701, 0.747, 
and 0.703 in the GSE36980 dataset and 0.870, 0.817, 0.902, and 0.834 in the 
GSE5281 dataset. In the GSE44770 dataset, PMSD14 (AUC, 0.838) and ITPKB (AUC, 
0.952) had very high diagnostic values in the early stage of AD. Finally, based 
on these diagnostic genes, we found that the drug Abemaciclib is a targeted drug 
for the treatment of age-related AD. Flutamide can aggravate aging-related AD.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that cellular SRGs might play an 
important role in AD. PMSD14, PEBP1, ITPKB, and ATF7IP have the potential as 
specific biomarkers for the early diagnosis of AD.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies only focused on changes in the global age-specific 
incidence and mortality for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, failed to 
distinguish between cohort and period effects, and did not discuss risk factors 
separately.
METHODS: In this study, Alzheimer's disease disability-adjusted life years 
(DALYs) data to estimate the burden by gender, age, locations, and 
social-demographic status for 21 regions from 1990 to 2019. Additionally, trend 
analysis was performed using the age-period-cohort (APC) model and Join-point 
model.
RESULTS: In most regions, indicators (incidence, mortality, and DALYs) increased 
steadily with socio-demographic index(SDI) increased. The age effects for 
Alzheimer's disease and other dementias showed a significant increase from 40 to 
95 years. The cohort effects rate ratios (RRs) had a rapid reduction attributed 
to smoking, high fasting plasma glucose, and high body mass index (BMI).
CONCLUSIONS: Countries in middle-low and low SDI regions have higher levels of 
risk factor exposure. As a result, rapid and effective government responses are 
necessary to control dementia risk factors and reduce the disease burden in 
these countries.

With an aging population, an increase in cases of Alzheimer's disease and 
dementia worldwide poses a significant health burden. While we hope for a cure, 
preventing dementia by reducing risks is important for global population health. 
Prevention strategies are difficult to implement when facing inequality across 
the world for access to healthy lifestyles. An approach that centers on 
individual responsibility and health professional interventions for targeted 
groups may risk missing the policy and environmental drivers of change. Barriers 
and enablers need to be explored and interventions are needed at individual, 
structural and social levels to normalize mid-life risk reduction.

Genome wide association study (GWAS) uncovered Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk 
genes linked to the endo-lysosomal pathway. This pathway seems to be the gateway 
of protein aggregates, such as tau and α-synuclein, to the cytoplasm. 
Furthermore, we and others reported that the amyloid precursor protein (APP) C99 
is predominantly processed by γ-secretase in the endo-lysosomal compartments, 
and β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides are enriched in the same subcellular loci. While the 
role(s) of APP/Aβ in the endo-lysosomal pathway has not been fully established, 
a recent study reported that Aβ, in particular Aβ42, inhibits cathepsin D (CTSD) 
activity. Here, we show using a cell-free in vitro assay that Aβ42 also blocks 
cathepsin B (CTSB) activity. Furthermore, we uncovered that the autocatalytic 
processing (i.e., conversion of single chain to heavy/light chains) of CTSB and 
CTSD is accelerated in APP-deficient cells compared with wild-type controls. 
Taken together, our findings further support the negative regulation of 
cathepsins by Aβ.

The nervous system is one of the most complicated and enigmatic systems within 
the animal kingdom. Recently, the emergence and development of spatial 
transcriptomics (ST) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies 
have provided an unprecedented ability to systematically decipher the cellular 
heterogeneity and spatial locations of the nervous system from multiple unbiased 
aspects. However, efficiently integrating, presenting and analyzing massive 
multiomic data remains a huge challenge. Here, we manually collected and 
comprehensively analyzed high-quality scRNA-seq and ST data from the nervous 
system, covering 10 679 684 cells. In addition, multi-omic datasets from more 
than 900 species were included for extensive data mining from an evolutionary 
perspective. Furthermore, over 100 neurological diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's 
disease, Parkinson's disease, Down syndrome) were systematically analyzed for 
high-throughput screening of putative biomarkers. Differential expression 
patterns across developmental time points, cell types and ST spots were 
discerned and subsequently subjected to extensive interpretation. To provide 
researchers with efficient data exploration, we created a new database with 
interactive interfaces and integrated functions called the Spatiotemporal Cloud 
Atlas for Neural cells (SCAN), freely accessible at http://47.98.139.124:8799 or 
http://scanatlas.net. SCAN will benefit the neuroscience research community to 
better exploit the spatiotemporal atlas of the neural system and promote the 
development of diagnostic strategies for various neurological disorders.

Amyloid-β, tau pathology, and biomarkers of neurodegeneration make up the core 
diagnostic biomarkers of Alzheimer disease (AD). However, these proteins 
represent only a fraction of the complex biological processes underlying AD, and 
individuals with other brain diseases in which AD pathology is a comorbidity 
also test positive for these diagnostic biomarkers. More AD-specific early 
diagnostic and disease staging biomarkers are needed. In this study, we 
performed tandem mass tag proteomic analysis of paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
and serum samples in a discovery cohort comprising 98 participants. Candidate 
biomarkers were validated by parallel reaction monitoring-based targeted 
proteomic assays in an independent multicenter cohort comprising 288 
participants. We quantified 3,238 CSF and 1,702 serum proteins in the discovery 
cohort, identifying 171 and 860 CSF proteins and 37 and 323 serum proteins as 
potential early diagnostic and staging biomarkers, respectively. In the 
validation cohort, 58 and 21 CSF proteins, as well as 12 and 18 serum proteins, 
were verified as early diagnostic and staging biomarkers, respectively. Separate 
19-protein CSF and an 8-protein serum biomarker panels were built by machine 
learning to accurately classify mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD from 
normal cognition with areas under the curve of 0.984 and 0.881, respectively. 
The 19-protein CSF biomarker panel also effectively discriminated patients with 
MCI due to AD from patients with other neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, we 
identified 21 CSF and 18 serum stage-associated proteins reflecting AD stages. 
Our findings provide a foundation for developing blood-based tests for AD 
screening and staging in clinical practice.

IMPORTANCE: Antiamyloid immunotherapies against Alzheimer disease (AD) are 
emerging. Scalable, cost-effective tools will be needed to identify amyloid β 
(Aβ)-positive patients without an advanced stage of tau pathology who are most 
likely to benefit from these therapies. Blood-based biomarkers might reduce the 
need to use cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or positron emission tomography (PET) for 
this.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate plasma biomarkers for identifying Aβ positivity and stage 
of tau accumulation.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The cohort study (BioFINDER-2) was a 
prospective memory-clinic and population-based study. Participants with 
cognitive concerns were recruited from 2017 to 2022 and divided into a training 
set (80% of the data) and test set (20%).
EXPOSURE: Baseline values for plasma phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181), 
p-tau217, p-tau231, N-terminal tau, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and 
neurofilament light chain.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Performance to classify participants by Aβ status 
(defined by Aβ-PET or CSF Aβ42/40) and tau status (tau PET). Number of 
hypothetically saved PET scans in a plasma biomarker-guided workflow.
RESULTS: Of a total 912 participants, there were 499 males (54.7%) and 413 
females (45.3%), and the mean (SD) age was 71.1 (8.49) years. Among the 
biomarkers, plasma p-tau217 was most strongly associated with Aβ positivity 
(test-set area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.94; 
95% CI, 0.90-0.97). A 2-cut-point procedure was evaluated, where only 
participants with ambiguous plasma p-tau217 values (17.1% of the participants in 
the test set) underwent CSF or PET to assign definitive Aβ status. This 
procedure had an overall sensitivity of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.90-0.98) and a 
specificity of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.77-0.95). Next, plasma biomarkers were used to 
differentiate low-intermediate vs high tau-PET load among Aβ-positive 
participants. Plasma p-tau217 again performed best, with the test AUC = 0.92 
(95% CI, 0.86-0.97), without significant improvement when adding any of the 
other plasma biomarkers. At a false-negative rate less than 10%, the use of 
plasma p-tau217 could avoid 56.9% of tau-PET scans needed to identify high tau 
PET among Aβ-positive participants. The results were validated in an independent 
cohort (n = 118).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that algorithms using plasma 
p-tau217 can accurately identify most Aβ-positive individuals, including those 
likely to have a high tau load who would require confirmatory tau-PET imaging. 
Plasma p-tau217 measurements may substantially reduce the number of invasive and 
costly confirmatory tests required to identify individuals who would likely 
benefit from antiamyloid therapies.

BACKGROUND: Parametric statistical methods are generally better than 
nonparametric, but require that data follow a known, usually normal, 
distribution. One important application is finding reference limits and 
detection limits. Parametric analyses yield better estimates and measures of 
their uncertainty than nonparametric approaches, which rely solely on a few 
extreme values. Some reference data follow normal distributions; some can be 
transformed to normal; some are normal or transformable to normal apart from a 
few extreme values; and detection and quantitation limits can lead to data 
censoring.
METHODS: A quantile-quantile (QQ) toolbox provides powerful general methodology 
for all these settings.
RESULTS: QQ methodology leads to a family of simple methods for finding optimal 
power transformations, testing for normality before and after transformation, 
estimating reference limits, and constructing confidence intervals.
CONCLUSIONS: These parametric methods have a particular appeal to clinical 
laboratorians because, while statistically rigorous, they do not require 
specialized software or statistical expertise, but can be implemented even in 
spreadsheets. We conclude with an exploration of reference values for amyloid 
beta proteins associated with Alzheimer disease.

BACKGROUND: Brain iron deposition is common in dementia, but whether serum iron 
is a causal risk factor is unknown. We aimed to determine whether genetic 
predisposition to higher serum iron status biomarkers increased risk of dementia 
and atrophy of grey matter.
METHODS: We analysed UK Biobank participants clustered into European (N=451284), 
African (N=7477) and South Asian (N=9570) groups by genetic similarity to the 
1000 genomes project. Using Mendelian randomisation methods, we estimated the 
association between genetically predicted serum iron (transferrin saturation 
[TSAT] and ferritin), grey matter volume and genetic liability to clinically 
defined dementia (including Alzheimer's disease [AD], non-AD dementia, and 
vascular dementia) from hospital and primary care records. We also performed 
time-to-event (competing risks) analysis of the TSAT polygenic score on risk of 
clinically defined non-AD dementia.
RESULTS: In Europeans, higher genetically predicted TSAT increased genetic 
liability to dementia (Odds Ratio [OR]: 1.15, 95% Confidence Intervals [CI] 1.04 
to 1.26, p=0.0051), non-AD dementia (OR: 1.27, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.45, p=0.00018) 
and vascular dementia (OR: 1.37, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.69, p=0.0023), but not AD (OR: 
1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.15, p=0.97). Higher TSAT was also associated with 
increased risk of non-AD dementia in participants of African, but not South 
Asian groups. In survival analysis using a TSAT polygenic score, the effect was 
independent of apolipoprotein-E ε4 genotype (with adjustment subdistribution 
Hazard Ratio: 1.74, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.28, p=0.00006). Genetically predicted TSAT 
was associated with lower grey matter volume in caudate, putamen and thalamus, 
and not in other areas of interest.
DISCUSSION: Genetic evidence supports a causal relationship between higher TSAT 
and risk of clinically defined non-AD and vascular dementia, in European and 
African groups. This association appears to be independent of apolipoprotein-E 
ε4.

Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) pathology is present in approximately 50% of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) cases at autopsy and might impact the age-of-onset and disease 
progression in AD. Here, we aimed to determine whether tau and aSyn profiles 
differ between AD cases with Lewy bodies (AD-LB), pure AD and Parkinson's 
disease with dementia (PDD) cases using epitope-, post-translational 
modification- (PTM) and isoform-specific tau and aSyn antibody panels spanning 
from the N- to C-terminus. We included the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and 
amygdala (AMY) of clinically diagnosed and pathologically confirmed cases and 
performed dot blotting, western blotting and immunohistochemistry combined with 
quantitative and morphological analyses. All investigated phospho-tau (pTau) 
species, except pT181, were upregulated in AD-LB and AD cases compared to PDD 
and control cases, but no significant differences were observed between AD-LB 
and AD subjects. In addition, tau antibodies targeting the proline-rich regions 
and C-terminus showed preferential binding to AD-LB and AD brain homogenates. 
Antibodies targeting C-terminal aSyn epitopes and pS129 aSyn showed stronger 
binding to AD-LB and PDD cases compared to AD and control cases. Two pTau 
species (pS198 and pS396) were specifically detected in the soluble protein 
fractions of AD-LB and AD subjects, indicative of early involvement of these 
PTMs in the multimerization process of tau. Other phospho-variants for both tau 
(pT212/S214, pT231 and pS422) and aSyn (pS129) were only detected in the 
insoluble protein fraction of AD-LB/AD and AD-LB/PDD cases, respectively. aSyn 
load was higher in the AMY of AD-LB cases compared to PDD cases, suggesting 
aggravated aSyn pathology under the presence of AD pathology, while tau load was 
similar between AD-LB and AD cases. Co-localization of pTau and aSyn could be 
observed within astrocytes of AD-LB cases within the MTG. These findings 
highlight a unique pathological signature for AD-LB cases compared to pure AD 
and PDD cases.

BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that a number of factors can influence 
blood-based biomarker levels for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's 
related dementias (ADRD). We examined the associations that demographic and 
clinical characteristics have with AD/ADRD blood-based biomarker levels in an 
observational continuation of a clinical trial cohort of older individuals with 
type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity.
METHODS: Participants aged 45-76 years were randomized to a 10-year Intensive 
Lifestyle Intervention (ILI) or a diabetes support and education (DSE) 
condition. Stored baseline and end of intervention (8-13 years later) plasma 
samples were analyzed with the Quanterix Simoa HD-X Analyzer. Changes in Aβ42, 
Aβ40, Aβ42/Aβ40, ptau181, neurofilament light chain (NfL), and glial fibrillary 
acidic protein (GFAP) were evaluated in relation to randomization status, 
demographic, and clinical characteristics.
RESULTS: In a sample of 779 participants from the Look AHEAD cohort, we found 
significant associations between blood-based biomarkers for AD/ADRD and 15 of 18 
demographic (age, gender, race and ethnicity, education) and clinical 
characteristics (APOE, depression, alcohol use, smoking, body mass index, HbA1c, 
diabetes duration, diabetes treatment, estimated glomerular filtration rate, 
hypertension, and history of cardiovascular disease) .
CONCLUSIONS: Blood-based biomarkers of AD/ADRD are influenced by common 
demographic and clinical characteristics. These factors should be considered 
carefully when interpreting these AD/ADRD blood biomarker values for clinical or 
research purposes.

Recently, an astrocytic aquaporin 4-dependent drainage system, that is, the 
glymphatic system, has been identified in the live murine and human brain. 
Growing evidence suggests that glymphatic function is impaired in patients with 
several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's 
disease. As the third most common neurodegenerative disease, although animal 
studies have indicated that early glymphatic dysfunction is likely an important 
pathological mechanism underpinning amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), no 
available study has been conducted to thoroughly assess glymphatic function in 
vivo in ALS patients to date, particularly in patients with early-stage ALS. 
Thus, using diffusion tensor imaging analysis along the perivascular space 
(ALPS) index, an approximate measure of glymphatic function in vivo, we aimed to 
explore whether glymphatic function is impaired in patients with patients with 
early-stage ALS, and the diagnostic performance of the ALPS index in 
distinguishing between patients with early-stage ALS and healthy subjects. We 
also aimed to identify the relationships between glymphatic dysfunction and 
clinical disabilities and sleep problems in patients with early-stage ALS. In 
this retrospective study, King's Stage 1 ALS patients were defined as patients 
with early-stage ALS. We enrolled 56 patients with early-stage ALS and 32 age- 
and sex-matched healthy control subjects. All participants completed clinical 
screening, sleep assessment and ALPS index analysis. For the sleep assessment, 
the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale and polysomnography 
were used. Compared with healthy control subjects, patients with early-stage ALS 
had a significantly lower ALPS index after family-wise error correction (P < 
0.05). Moreover, receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the area 
under the curve for the ALPS index was 0.792 (95% confidence interval 
0.700-0.884). Partial correlation analyses showed that the ALPS index was 
significantly correlated with clinical disability and sleep disturbances in 
patients with early-stage ALS. Multivariate analysis showed that sleep 
efficiency (r = 0.419, P = 0.002) and periodic limb movements in sleep index (r 
= -0.294, P = 0.017) were significant predictive factors of the ALPS index in 
patients with early-stage ALS. In conclusion, our study continues to support an 
important role for glymphatic dysfunction in ALS pathology, and we provide 
additional insights into the early diagnostic value of glymphatic dysfunction 
and its correlation with sleep disturbances in vivo in patients with early-stage 
ALS. Moreover, we suggest that early improvement of glymphatic function may be a 
promising strategy for slowing the neurodegenerative process in ALS. Future 
studies are needed to explore the diagnostic and therapeutic value of glymphatic 
dysfunction in individuals with presymptomatic-stage neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is 
not only a response to pathophysiological events, but also plays a causative 
role in neurodegeneration. Cytoplasmic cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CARS) is 
considered to be a stimulant for immune responses to diseases; however, it 
remains unknown whether CARS is involved in the pathogenesis of AD.
METHODS: Postmortem human temporal cortical tissues at different Braak stages 
and AD patient-derived serum samples were used to investigate the changes of 
CARS levels in AD by immunocytochemical staining, real-time PCR, western 
blotting and ELISA. After that, C57BL/6J and APP/PS1 transgenic mice and BV-2 
cell line were used to explore the role of CARS protein in memory and 
neuroinflammation, as well as the underlying mechanisms. Finally, the 
associations of morphological features among CARS protein, microglia and 
dense-core plaques were examined by immunocytochemical staining.
RESULTS: A positive correlation was found between aging and the intensity of 
CARS immunoreactivity in the temporal cortex. Both protein and mRNA levels of 
CARS were increased in the temporal cortex of AD patients. Immunocytochemical 
staining revealed increased CARS immunoreactivity in neurons of the temporal 
cortex in AD patients. Moreover, overexpression of CARS in hippocampal neurons 
induced and aggravated cognitive dysfunction in C57BL/6J and APP/PS1 mice, 
respectively, accompanied by activation of microglia and the TLR2/MyD88 
signaling pathway as well as upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. In vitro 
experiments showed that CARS treatment facilitated the production of 
proinflammatory cytokines and the activation of the TLR2/MyD88 signaling pathway 
of BV-2 cells. The accumulation of CARS protein occurred within dense-core Aβ 
plaques accompanied by recruitment of ameboid microglia. Significant 
upregulation of TLR2/MyD88 proteins was also observed in the temporal cortex of 
AD.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the neuronal CARS drives 
neuroinflammation and induces memory deficits, which might be involved in the 
pathogenesis of AD.

BACKGROUND: Widescale evidence points to the involvement of glia and immune 
pathways in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD-associated 
iPSC-derived glial cells show a diverse range of AD-related phenotypic states 
encompassing cytokine/chemokine release, phagocytosis and morphological 
profiles, but to date studies are limited to cells derived from PSEN1, APOE and 
APP mutations or sporadic patients. The aim of the current study was to 
successfully differentiate iPSC-derived microglia and astrocytes from patients 
harbouring an AD-causative PSEN2 (N141I) mutation and characterise the 
inflammatory and morphological profile of these cells.
METHODS: iPSCs from three healthy control individuals and three familial AD 
patients harbouring a heterozygous PSEN2 (N141I) mutation were used to derive 
astrocytes and microglia-like cells and cell identity and morphology were 
characterised through immunofluorescent microscopy. Cellular characterisation 
involved the stimulation of these cells by LPS and Aβ42 and analysis of 
cytokine/chemokine release was conducted through ELISAs and multi-cytokine 
arrays. The phagocytic capacity of these cells was then indexed by the uptake of 
fluorescently-labelled fibrillar Aβ42.
RESULTS: AD-derived astrocytes and microglia-like cells exhibited an atrophied 
and less complex morphological appearance than healthy controls. AD-derived 
astrocytes showed increased basal expression of GFAP, S100β and increased 
secretion and phagocytosis of Aβ42 while AD-derived microglia-like cells showed 
decreased IL-8 secretion compared to healthy controls. Upon immunological 
challenge AD-derived astrocytes and microglia-like cells showed exaggerated 
secretion of the pro-inflammatory IL-6, CXCL1, ICAM-1 and IL-8 from astrocytes 
and IL-18 and MIF from microglia.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed, for the first time, the differentiation and 
characterisation of iPSC-derived astrocytes and microglia-like cells harbouring 
a PSEN2 (N141I) mutation. PSEN2 (N141I)-mutant astrocytes and microglia-like 
cells presented with a 'primed' phenotype characterised by reduced morphological 
complexity, exaggerated pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and altered Aβ42 
production and phagocytosis.

Nuclear clearance and cytoplasmic accumulations of the RNA-binding protein 
TDP-43 are pathological hallmarks in almost all patients with amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS) and up to 50% of patients with frontotemporal dementia 
(FTD) and Alzheimer's disease. In Alzheimer's disease, TDP-43 pathology is 
predominantly observed in the limbic system and correlates with cognitive 
decline and reduced hippocampal volume. Disruption of nuclear TDP-43 function 
leads to abnormal RNA splicing and incorporation of erroneous cryptic exons in 
numerous transcripts including Stathmin-2 (STMN2, also known as SCG10) and 
UNC13A, recently reported in tissues from patients with ALS and FTD. Here, we 
identify both STMN2 and UNC13A cryptic exons in Alzheimer's disease patients, 
that correlate with TDP-43 pathology burden, but not with amyloid-β or tau 
deposits. We also demonstrate that processing of the STMN2 pre-mRNA is more 
sensitive to TDP-43 loss of function than UNC13A. In addition, full-length RNAs 
encoding STMN2 and UNC13A are suppressed in large RNA-seq datasets generated 
from Alzheimer's disease post-mortem brain tissue. Collectively, these results 
open exciting new avenues to use STMN2 and UNC13A as potential therapeutic 
targets in a broad range of neurodegenerative conditions with TDP-43 
proteinopathy including Alzheimer's disease.

Update of
    medRxiv. 2023 Jul 14;:

Treatments for neurodegenerative disorders remain rare, but recent FDA 
approvals, such as lecanemab and aducanumab for Alzheimer disease (MIM: 607822), 
highlight the importance of the underlying biological mechanisms in driving 
discovery and creating disease modifying therapies. The global population is 
aging, driving an urgent need for therapeutics that stop disease progression and 
eliminate symptoms. In this study, we create an open framework and resource for 
evidence-based identification of therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative 
disease. We use summary-data-based Mendelian randomization to identify genetic 
targets for drug discovery and repurposing. In parallel, we provide mechanistic 
insights into disease processes and potential network-level consequences of 
gene-based therapeutics. We identify 116 Alzheimer disease, 3 amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (MIM: 105400), 5 Lewy body dementia (MIM: 127750), 46 
Parkinson disease (MIM: 605909), and 9 progressive supranuclear palsy (MIM: 
601104) target genes passing multiple test corrections (pSMR_multi < 2.95 × 10-6 
and pHEIDI > 0.01). We created a therapeutic scheme to classify our identified 
target genes into strata based on druggability and approved therapeutics, 
classifying 41 novel targets, 3 known targets, and 115 difficult targets (of 
these, 69.8% are expressed in the disease-relevant cell type from single-nucleus 
experiments). Our novel class of genes provides a springboard for new 
opportunities in drug discovery, development, and repurposing in the 
pre-competitive space. In addition, looking at drug-gene interaction networks, 
we identify previous trials that may require further follow-up such as riluzole 
in Alzheimer disease. We also provide a user-friendly web platform to help users 
explore potential therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases, decreasing 
activation energy for the community.

BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that hyperglycemia is a 
possible risk factor for mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease. 
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) has been identified as a risk factor for dementia in 
patients with diabetes.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the causal relationships between DR 
and brain structure, cognitive function, and dementia.
METHODS: We performed bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization for DR, 
brain structure, cognitive function, and dementia using the inverse-variance 
weighted method.
RESULTS: Inverse-variance weighted analysis showed the association of DR with 
vascular dementia (OR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.01-2.82), and dementia was significantly 
associated with the increased risk of non-proliferative DR (NPDR) (OR = 1.76, 
95% CI: 1.04-2.98). Furthermore, better cognitive performance was significantly 
associated with a reduced risk of NPDR (OR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.74-0.98). No 
association was observed between DR and brain structure.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the association of DR with vascular 
dementia. The reciprocal effect of cognitive performance and dementia on NPDR 
risk highlights the potential benefits of dementia prevention for reducing the 
burden of DR.

Pre-training and ensembling based Alzheimer's disease detection.

Xu F, Zheng Q, Shi J, Yan K, Wang M.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) endangers the physical and mental health of 
the elderly, constituting one of the most crucial social challenges. Due to lack 
of effective AD intervention drugs, it is very important to diagnose AD in the 
early stage, especially in the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) phase.
OBJECTIVE: At present, an automatic classification technology is urgently needed 
to assist doctors in analyzing the status of the candidate patient. The 
artificial intelligence enhanced Alzheimer's disease detection can reduce costs 
to detect Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: In this paper, a novel pre-trained ensemble-based AD detection (PEADD) 
framework with three base learners (i.e., ResNet, VGG, and EfficientNet) for 
both the audio-based and PET (Positron Emission Tomography)-based AD detection 
is proposed under a unified image modality. Specifically, the effectiveness of 
context-enriched image modalities instead of the traditional speech modality 
(i.e., context-free audio matrix) for the audio-based AD detection, along with 
simple and efficient image denoising strategy has been inspected 
comprehensively. Meanwhile, the PET-based AD detection based on the denoised PET 
image has been described. Furthermore, different voting methods for applying an 
ensemble strategy (i.e., hard voting and soft voting) has been investigated in 
detail.
RESULTS: The results showed that the classification accuracy was 92% and 99% on 
the audio-based and PET-based AD datasets, respectively. Our extensive 
experimental results demonstrate that our PEADD outperforms the state-of-the-art 
methods on both audio-based and PET-based AD datasets simultaneously.
CONCLUSIONS: The network model can provide an objective basis for doctors to 
detect Alzheimer's Disease.

BACKGROUND: The present study investigates the interrelated pathophysiology of 
depression and Alzheimer's disease (AD), with the objective of elucidating 
common underlying mechanisms.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to identify previously undiscovered biogenic 
compounds from the NuBBE database that specifically interact with GluR3. This 
study examines the bidirectional association between depression and AD, 
specifically focusing on the role of depression as a risk factor in the onset 
and progression of the disease.
METHODS: In this study, we utilize pharmacokinetics, homology modeling, and 
molecular docking-based virtual screening techniques to examine the GluR3 AMPA 
receptor subunit.
RESULTS: The compounds, namely ZINC000002558953, ZINC000001228056, 
ZINC000000187911, ZINC000003954487, and ZINC000002040988, exhibited favorable 
pharmacokinetic profiles and drug-like characteristics, displaying high binding 
affinities to the GluR3 binding pocket.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that targeting GluR3 could hold promise for 
the development of therapies for depression and AD. Further validation through 
in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies is necessary to explore the potential of 
these compounds as lead candidates for potent and selective GluR3 inhibitors. 
The shared molecular mechanisms between depression and AD provide an opportunity 
for novel treatment approaches that address both conditions simultaneously.

The protein homeostasis network keeps proteins in their correct shapes and 
avoids unwanted aggregation. In turn, the accumulation of aberrantly misfolded 
proteins has been directly associated with the onset of ageing-associated 
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. However, a 
detailed and rational understanding of how protein homeostasis is achieved in 
health, and how it can be targeted for therapeutic intervention in diseases 
remains missing. Here, large-scale single-cell expression data from the Allen 
Brain Map are analysed to investigate the transcription regulation of the core 
protein homeostasis network across the human brain. Remarkably, distinct 
expression profiles suggest specialized protein homeostasis networks with 
systematic adaptations in excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons and 
non-neuronal cells. Moreover, several chaperones and Ubiquitin ligases are found 
transcriptionally coregulated with genes important for synapse formation and 
maintenance, thus linking protein homeostasis to the regulation of neuronal 
function. Finally, evolutionary analyses highlight the conservation of an 
elevated interaction density in the chaperone network, suggesting that one of 
the most exciting aspects of chaperone action may yet be discovered in their 
collective action at the systems level. More generally, our work highlights the 
power of computational analyses for breaking down complexity and gaining 
complementary insights into fundamental biological problems.

INTRODUCTION: Recent data suggest that distinct prion-like amyloid beta and tau 
strains are associated with rapidly progressive Alzheimer's disease (rpAD). The 
role of genetic factors in rpAD is largely unknown.
METHODS: Previously known AD risk loci were examined in rpAD cases. Genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS) were performed to identify variants that influence 
rpAD.
RESULTS: We identified 115 pathology-confirmed rpAD cases and 193 clinical rpAD 
cases, 80% and 69% were of non-Hispanic European ancestry. Compared to the 
clinical cohort, pathology-confirmed rpAD had higher frequencies of 
apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 and rare missense variants in AD risk genes. A novel 
genome-wide significant locus (P < 5×10-8 ) was observed for clinical rpAD on 
chromosome 21 (rs2832546); 102 loci showed suggestive associations with 
pathology-confirmed rpAD (P < 1×10-5 ). DISCUSSION rpAD constitutes an extreme 
subtype of AD with distinct features. GWAS found previously known and novel loci 
associated with rpAD. Highlights Rapidly progressive Alzheimer's disease (rpAD) 
was defined with different criteria. Whole genome sequencing identified rare 
missense variants in rpAD. Novel variants were identified for clinical rpAD on 
chromosome 21.

The Holocene (beginning around 12,000 years ago) encompassed some of the most 
significant changes in human evolution, with far-reaching consequences for the 
dietary, physical and mental health of present-day populations. Using a dataset 
of more than 1,600 imputed ancient genomes1, we modelled the selection landscape 
during the transition from hunting and gathering, to farming and pastoralism 
across West Eurasia. We identify key selection signals related to metabolism, 
including that selection at the FADS cluster began earlier than previously 
reported and that selection near the LCT locus predates the emergence of the 
lactase persistence allele by thousands of years. We also find strong selection 
in the HLA region, possibly due to increased exposure to pathogens during the 
Bronze Age. Using ancient individuals to infer local ancestry tracts in over 
400,000 samples from the UK Biobank, we identify widespread differences in the 
distribution of Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age ancestries across Eurasia. 
By calculating ancestry-specific polygenic risk scores, we show that height 
differences between Northern and Southern Europe are associated with 
differential Steppe ancestry, rather than selection, and that risk alleles for 
mood-related phenotypes are enriched for Neolithic farmer ancestry, whereas risk 
alleles for diabetes and Alzheimer's disease are enriched for Western 
hunter-gatherer ancestry. Our results indicate that ancient selection and 
migration were large contributors to the distribution of phenotypic diversity in 
present-day Europeans.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and multifactorial neurodegenerative 
disorder characterized by cognitive decline, memory loss, behavioral changes, 
and other neurological symptoms. Considering the urgent need for new AD 
therapeutics, in the present study we designed, synthesized, and evaluated 
multitarget compounds structurally inspired by sulfonylureas and pitolisant with 
the aim of obtaining multitarget ligands for AD treatment. Due to the diversity 
of chemical scaffolds, a novel strategy has been adopted by merging into one 
structure moieties displaying H3R antagonism and acetylcholinesterase 
inhibition. Eight compounds, selected by their binding activity on H3R, showed a 
moderate ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity in vitro, and two of 
the compounds (derivatives 2 and 7) were also capable of increasing 
acetylcholine release in vitro. Among the tested compounds, derivative 2 was 
identified and selected for further in vivo studies. Compound 2 was able to 
reverse scopolamine-induced cognitive deficits with results comparable to those 
of galantamine, a drug used in clinics for treating AD. In addition to its 
efficacy, this compound showed moderate BBB permeation in vitro. Altogether, 
these results point out that the fragment-like character of compound 2 leads to

Post-mortem staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD) neurofibrillary pathology is 
commonly performed by immunohistochemistry using AT8 antibody for phosphorylated 
tau (p-tau) at positions 202/205. Thus, quantification of p-tau205 and p-tau202 
in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) should be more reflective of neurofibrillary 
tangles in AD than other p-tau epitopes. We developed two novel Simoa 
immunoassays for CSF p-tau205 and p-tau202 and measured these phosphorylations 
in three independent cohorts encompassing the AD continuum, non-AD cases and 
cognitively unimpaired participants: a discovery cohort (n = 47), an unselected 
clinical cohort (n = 212) and a research cohort well-characterized by fluid and 
imaging biomarkers (n = 262). CSF p-tau205 increased progressively across the AD 
continuum, while CSF p-tau202 was increased only in AD and amyloid (Aβ) and tau 
pathology positive (A+T+) cases (P < 0.01). In A+ cases, CSF p-tau205 and 
p-tau202 showed stronger associations with tau-PET (rSp205 = 0.67, 
rSp202 = 0.45) than Aβ-PET (rSp205 = 0.40, rSp202 = 0.09). CSF p-tau205 
increased gradually across tau-PET Braak stages (P < 0.01), whereas p-tau202 
only increased in Braak V-VI (P < 0.0001). Both showed stronger regional 
associations with tau-PET than with Aβ-PET, and CSF p-tau205 was significantly 
associated with Braak V-VI tau-PET regions. When assessing the contribution of 
Aβ and tau pathologies (indexed by PET) to CSF p-tau205 and p-tau202 variance, 
tau pathology was found to be the most prominent contributor in both cases (CSF 
p-tau205: R2 = 69.7%; CSF p-tau202: R2 = 85.6%) Both biomarkers associated with 
brain atrophy measurements globally (rSp205 = - 0.36, rSp202 = - 0.33) and 
regionally, and correlated with cognition (rSp205 = - 0.38/- 0.40, 
rSp202 = - 0.20/- 0.29). In conclusion, we report the first high-throughput CSF 
p-tau205 immunoassay for the in vivo quantification of tau pathology in AD, and 
a potentially cost-effective alternative to tau-PET in clinical settings and 
clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) are 
the two main causes of dementia. AD and VCI share similar symptoms of cognitive 
decline and may be attributable to similar risk factors. Establishing a 
prospective cohort to compare VCI and AD would help to understand vascular risk 
factors related to dementia.
OBJECTIVES: China Alzheimer's disease and Neurodegenerative Disorder Research 
(CANDOR) study is a prospective multicenter cohort study. It aims to study the 
similarities and differences between AD and post stroke cognitive impairment 
(PSCI) in neuroimaging changes, disease progression, and multiple omics studies.
DESIGN: This is an ongoing study. From July 31, 2019, to August 1, 2022, we 
recruited 1449 participants with ages between 40 and 100 years. The cohort 
included three groups: AD group, PSCI group, and normal cognitive (NC) group. 
Data were collected in face-to-face interviews at baseline, and will be followed 
up every year for 4 years. The PSCI group had additional follow-ups at 3-month 
and 6-month after enrollment. Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) included 
high-resolution sequences for intracranial arteries. Cognitive assessments and 
follow-up information will be prospectively collected. Biological specimens 
including blood and urine at baseline were collected and tested.
PARTICIPANTS: The targeted sample size of PSCI group was 500, AD group with 600 
and NC group with 2000. There were 1449 participants enrolled. Include 508 
participants were in NC group, 387 in AD group and 554 in PSCI group.
MEASUREMENTS: Demographics, clinical parameters, and medical examinations were 
collected and performed. Cognitive assessment was performed to assess all 
cognitive domains including memory, language, executive function, and 
orientation function.
CONCLUSIONS: The CANDOR study is a prospective cohort study. Data from this 
cohort provide us an opportunity to investigate the contribution of vascular 
factors to dementia pathogenesis.

INTRODUCTION: With emergence of disease-modifying therapies, efficient 
diagnostic pathways are critically needed to identify treatment candidates, 
evaluate disease severity, and support prognosis. A combination of plasma 
biomarkers and brief digital cognitive assessments could provide a scalable 
alternative to current diagnostic work-up.
METHODS: We examined the accuracy of plasma biomarkers and a 10-minute 
supervised tablet-based cognitive assessment (Tablet-based Cognitive Assessment 
Tool Brain Health Assessment [TabCAT-BHA]) in predicting amyloid β positive 
(Aβ+) status on positron emission tomography (PET), concurrent disease severity, 
and functional decline in 309 older adults with subjective cognitive impairment 
(n = 49), mild cognitive impairment (n = 159), and dementia (n = 101).
RESULTS: Combination of plasma pTau181, Aβ42/40, neurofilament light (NfL), and 
TabCAT-BHA was optimal for predicting Aβ-PET positivity (AUC = 0.962). Whereas 
NfL and TabCAT-BHA optimally predicted concurrent disease severity, combining 
these with pTau181 and glial fibrillary acidic protein was most accurate in 
predicting functional decline.
DISCUSSION: Combinations of plasma and digital cognitive markers show promise 
for scalable diagnosis and prognosis of ADRD.
HIGHLIGHTS: The need for cost-efficient diagnostic and prognostic markers of AD 
is urgent. Plasma and digital cognitive markers provide complementary diagnostic 
contributions. Combination of these markers holds promise for scalable diagnosis 
and prognosis. Future validation in community cohorts is needed to inform 
clinical implementation.

Alzheimer's disease is a form of general dementia marked by amyloid plaques, 
neurofibrillary tangles, and neuron degeneration. The disease has no cure, and 
early detection is critical in improving patient outcomes. Magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) is important in measuring neurodegeneration during the disease. 
Computer-aided image processing tools have been used to aid medical 
professionals in ascertaining a diagnosis of Alzheimer's in its early stages. As 
characteristics of non and very-mild dementia stages overlap, tracking the 
progression is challenging. Our work developed an adaptive multi-thresholding 
algorithm based on the morphology of the smoothed histogram to define features 
identifying neurodegeneration and track its progression as non, very mild, mild, 
and moderate. Gray and white matter volume, statistical moments, 
multi-thresholds, shrinkage, gray-to-white matter ratio, and three distance and 
angle values are mathematically derived. Decision tree, discriminant analysis, 
Naïve Bayes, SVM, KNN, ensemble, and neural network classifiers are designed to 
evaluate the proposed methodology with the performance metrics accuracy, recall, 
specificity, precision, F1 score, Matthew's correlation coefficient, and Kappa 
values. Experimental results showed that the proposed features successfully 
label the neurodegeneration stages.

INTRODUCTION: Clinical research in Alzheimer's disease (AD) lacks cohort 
diversity despite being a global health crisis. The Asian Cohort for Alzheimer's 
Disease (ACAD) was formed to address underrepresentation of Asians in research, 
and limited understanding of how genetics and non-genetic/lifestyle factors 
impact this multi-ethnic population.
METHODS: The ACAD started fully recruiting in October 2021 with one central 
coordination site, eight recruitment sites, and two analysis sites. We developed 
a comprehensive study protocol for outreach and recruitment, an extensive data 
collection packet, and a centralized data management system, in English, 
Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese.
RESULTS: ACAD has recruited 606 participants with an additional 900 expressing 
interest in enrollment since program inception.
DISCUSSION: ACAD's traction indicates the feasibility of recruiting Asians for 
clinical research to enhance understanding of AD risk factors. ACAD will 
recruit > 5000 participants to identify genetic and non-genetic/lifestyle AD 
risk factors, establish blood biomarker levels for AD diagnosis, and facilitate 
clinical trial readiness.
HIGHLIGHTS: The Asian Cohort for Alzheimer's Disease (ACAD) promotes awareness 
of under-investment in clinical research for Asians. We are recruiting Asian 
Americans and Canadians for novel insights into Alzheimer's disease. We describe 
culturally appropriate recruitment strategies and data collection protocol. ACAD 
addresses challenges of recruitment from heterogeneous Asian subcommunities. We 
aim to implement a successful recruitment program that enrolls across three 
Asian subcommunities.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology can be disclosed in vivo using 
amyloid and tau imaging, unlike non-AD neuropathologies for which no specific 
markers exist.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare brain hypometabolism and tauopathy to unveil 
non-AD pathologies.
METHODS: Sixty-one patients presenting cognitive complaints (age 48-90), 
including 32 with positive AD biomarkers (52%), performed 
[18F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET (brain metabolism) and [18F]-MK-6240-PET 
(tau). We normalized these images using data from clinically normal individuals 
(n = 30), resulting in comparable FDG and tau z-scores. We computed 
between-patients correlations to evaluate regional associations. For each 
patient, a predominant biomarker (i.e., Hypometabolism > Tauopathy or 
Hypometabolism≤Tauopathy) was determined in the temporal and frontoparietal 
lobes. We computed within-patient correlations between tau and metabolism and 
investigated their associations with demographics, cognition, cardiovascular 
risk factors (CVRF), CSF biomarkers, and white matter hypointensities (WMH).
RESULTS: We observed negative associations between tau and FDG in 37 of the 68 
cortical regions-of-interest (average Pearson's r = -0.25), mainly in the 
temporal lobe. Thirteen patients (21%) had Hypometabolism > Tauopathy whereas 
twenty-five patients (41%) had Hypometabolism≤Tauopathy. Tau-predominant 
patients were more frequently females and had greater amyloid burden. 
Twenty-three patients (38%) had Hypometabolism≤Tauopathy in the temporal lobe, 
but Hypometabolism > Tauopathy in the frontoparietal lobe. This group was older 
and had higher CVRF than Tau-predominant patients. Patients with more negative 
associations between tau and metabolism were younger, had worse cognition, and 
greater amyloid and WMH burdens.
CONCLUSIONS: Tau-FDG comparison can help suspect non-AD pathologies in patients 
presenting cognitive complaints. Stronger Tau-FDG correlations are associated 
with younger age, worse cognition, and greater amyloid and WMH burdens.

BACKGROUND: Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) and logopenic progressive aphasia 
(LPA) are two common atypical Alzheimer's disease (AD) variants. Little is known 
about behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms or activities of daily living 
(ADLs) in PCA and LPA, and whether they differ across syndromes.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize the behavioral and neuropsychiatric profiles and ADLs 
of PCA and LPA and compare presence/absence and severity of symptoms between 
syndromes.
METHODS: Seventy-eight atypical AD patients, 46 with PCA and 32 with LPA, 
completed the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) and Cambridge 
Behavioral Inventory-Revised (CBI-R) at baseline and longitudinally over-time. 
Mann-Whitney U and Fisher's Exact Tests assessed for differences in symptoms 
between the two syndromes with significance set at p≤0.01. To eliminate 
demographic differences as confounders the groups were matched, and differences 
reanalyzed.
RESULTS: PCA were younger at onset (p = 0.006), at time of baseline assessment 
(p = 0.02) and had longer disease duration (p = 0.01). Neuropsychiatric symptoms 
were common in PCA and LPA, although more common and severe in PCA. At baseline, 
PCA had a higher NPI-Q total score (p = 0.01) and depression subscore (p = 0.01) 
than LPA. Baseline total CBI-R scores were also higher in PCA than LPA 
(p = 0.001) with PCA having worse scores in all 10 CBI-R categories. 
Longitudinally, there was no difference between groups on the NPI-Q. However, on 
the CBI-R, PCA had faster rates of worsening on self-grooming (p = 0.01) and 
self-dressing (p = 0.01) compared to LPA.
CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in PCA and LPA 
although these symptoms are more common and severe in PCA.

BACKGROUND: Evidence describing the association between hypnotics use and 
dementia risk is conflicting. It is unknown if the controversy is related to the 
type or dose of hypnotics or if hypnotics affect different populations.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to derive lessons learned and future projections based on 
evidence from longitudinal studies.
MEASUREMENTS: In the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, 
1,543 older adults without dementia (mean age = 73.3 years, female = 45%) were 
followed for four years. The association between hypnotics and the risk of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) was investigated using Cox proportional hazards 
regressions. Next, electronic databases were searched until March 2022 to 
conduct the evidence synthesis of the associations of hypnotics with incident 
risk of dementia.
RESULTS: In the ADNI cohort, ever use of hypnotics was associated with an 
increased risk of AD (hazard ratio = 1.96, 95% confidence intervals = 1.23-3.11, 
p < 0.01). This association was significant for benzodiazepines and Z-drugs but 
not for melatonin. The association was stronger in long-term (more than one 
year) users and those with high cumulative doses. A meta-analysis of 26 
longitudinal studies with 3,942,018 participants revealed a correlation between 
the use of hypnotics and the risk of dementia (relative risk = 1.23, 95% 
confidence intervals = 1.13-1.33, p < 0.001, median risk difference = 4%). It is 
a linear dose-response relationship, if a person takes the daily recommended 
dose for 100 days, their risk of developing dementia increases by 5% relative to 
non-users. According to subgroup analyses, neither association was significant 
among patients with a history of insomnia.
CONCLUSIONS: Individuals who use hypnotics, especially high-dose or long-term 
users, are at a higher risk of dementia and AD. The main issue with conclusion 
credibility is heterogeneity.

Lignan phytomolecules demonstrate promising anti-Alzheimer activity by 
alleviating dementia and preserving nerve cells. The purpose of this work is to 
characterize the lignans of Anisacanthus virgularis and explore their potential 
anti-acetylcholinesterase and anti-ageing effects. Phytochemical investigation 
of A. virgularis aerial parts afforded a new furofuranoid-type lignan (1), four 
known structural analogues, namely pinoresinol (2), epipinoresinol (3), 
phillyrin (4), and pinoresinol 4-O-β-d-glucoside (5), in addition to 
p-methoxy-trans-methyl cinnamate (6) and 1H-indole-3-carboxaldehyde (7). The 
structures were established from thorough spectroscopic analyses and comparisons 
with the literature. Assessment of the anticholinesterase activity of the 
lignans 1-5 displayed noticeable enzyme inhibition of 1 (IC50 = 85.03 ± 4.26 nM) 
and 5 (64.47 ± 2.75 nM) but lower activity of compounds 2-4 as compared to the 
reference drug donepezil. These findings were further emphasized by molecular 
docking of 1 and 5 with acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Rapid overlay chemical 
similarity (ROCS) and structure-activity relationships (SAR) analysis 
highlighted and rationalized the anti-AD capability of these compounds. 
Telomerase activation testing of the same isolates revealed 1.64-, 1.66-, and 
1.72-fold activations in cells treated with compounds 1, 5, and 4, respectively, 
compared to untreated cells. Our findings may pave the way for further 
investigations into the development of anti-Alzheimer and/or anti-ageing drugs 
from furofuranoid-type lignans.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: As a chronic inflammatory disease, periodontitis 
threatens oral health and is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). There 
is growing evidence that these two diseases are closely related. However, 
current research is still incomplete in understanding the common genes and 
common mechanisms between periodontitis and AD. In this study, we aimed to 
identify common genes in periodontitis and AD and analyze the relationship 
between crucial genes and immune cells to provide new therapeutic targets for 
clinical treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
specific to periodontitis and AD. Co-expressed genes were identified by 
obtaining gene expression profile data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
database. Using the STRING database, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks 
were constructed, and essential genes were identified. We also used four 
algorithms to identify critical genes and constructed regulatory networks. The 
association of crucial genes with immune cells and potential therapeutic effects 
was also assessed.
RESULTS: PDGFRB, VCAN, TIMP1, CHL1, EFEMP2, and IGFBP5 were obtained as crucial 
common genes. Immune infiltration analysis showed that Natural killer cells and 
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells were significantly differentially expressed in 
patients with PD and AD compared with the normal group. FOXC1 and GATA2 are 
important TFs for PD and AD. MiR-23a, miR-23b, miR-23a, and miR-23b were 
associated with AD and PD. Finally, the hub genes retrieved from the DSigDB 
database indicate multiple drug molecule and drug-target interactions.
CONCLUSION: This study reveals commonalities in common hub genes and immune 
infiltration between periodontitis and AD, and the analysis of six hub genes and 
immune cells may provide new insights into potential therapeutic directions for 
the pathogenesis of periodontitis complicated by AD.

BACKGROUND: Obesity significantly increases Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
dementia risk. Understanding the link between a high body mass index (BMI) and 
these conditions is crucial for effective management and prevention.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to estimate the burden of AD and other dementias attributed 
to high BMI from 1990 to 2019 based on sex, age, and socio-demographic 
indicators (SDI) at global, regional, and national levels.
METHODS: We collected data on deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), 
age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR), and age-standardized DALY rates (ASDR) 
from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease study for AD and dementia attributed to 
high BMI. We explored the correlation between SDI levels and ASDR.
RESULTS: In 2019, there were 198,476.2 deaths (95% UI: 32,695.4-593,366.4) and 
3,159,912.4 DALYs (848,330.5-8,042,531) attributed to high BMI. Numbers of 
deaths, DALYs, ASMR, and ASDR increased since 1990. Females had higher deaths, 
ASMR, and ASDR than males. Mortality and DALYs rates increased with age. ASMR 
and ASDR increased across five SDI levels, with the highest rise in Low-middle 
SDI. High-income North America had the most deaths [30,993.9 
(5,101.7-89,912.9)], while North Africa and the Middle East had the highest ASMR 
[4.61 (0.79-13.64)] and ASDR [72.56 (20.98-181.16)] in 2019.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of AD and other dementias attributed to high BMI 
increased since 1990 globally and is still heaviest in developed regions. 
Females accounted predominantly for the burden than males. Timely measures are 
needed to against high BMI.

In Alzheimer's disease, amyloid-beta (Aβ) triggers the trans-synaptic spread of 
tau pathology, and aberrant synaptic activity has been shown to promote tau 
spreading. Aβ induces aberrant synaptic activity, manifesting in increases in 
the presynaptic growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), which is closely involved 
in synaptic activity and plasticity. We therefore tested whether Aβ-related 
GAP-43 increases, as a marker of synaptic changes, drive tau spreading in 93 
patients across the aging and Alzheimer's spectrum with available CSF GAP-43, 
amyloid-PET and longitudinal tau-PET assessments. We found that (1) higher 
GAP-43 was associated with faster Aβ-related tau accumulation, specifically in 
brain regions connected closest to subject-specific tau epicenters and (2) that 
higher GAP-43 strengthened the association between Aβ and 
connectivity-associated tau spread. This suggests that GAP-43-related synaptic 
changes are linked to faster Aβ-related tau spread across connected regions and 
that synapses could be key targets for preventing tau spreading in Alzheimer's 
disease.

BACKGROUND: Physalin B (PB) is one of the main active compounds of Solanaceae 
plants, with a wide range of biological activities. PB reportedly has the 
potential to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD).
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the effect of PB on Tau 
phosphorylation and cell apoptosis using Tau-expressing HEK293 cells 
(HEK293/Tau) as a cellular model.
METHODS: The optimum concentration of PB to treat HEK293/Tau cells was 
determined using the CCK-8 assay. Additionally, the expression of FoxO1, Tau-5, 
p-Tau (T231, S262, and S404), ERK, p-ERK, GSK-3β, and p-GSK-3β was detected 
using western blotting to determine the effect of PB on Tau phosphorylation. The 
apoptosis rate was detected using flow cytometry, and the expression of Bax and 
Bcl-2 was detected using western blotting and verified using real-time 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Moreover, cells were 
transfected with FoxO1 siRNA to downregulate FoxO1 expression, and the 
expression of the above-mentioned proteins was detected to verify the effect of 
PB on Tau phosphorylation and cell apoptosis.
RESULTS: After 24 h of PB treatment, the phosphorylation levels of Tau at S404, 
S262, and T231 sites decreased significantly, and the activities of GSK-3β and 
ERK were inhibited. PB also reduced cell apoptosis by reducing the expression of 
Bax and increasing the expression of Bcl-2. In addition, PB decreased Tau 
phosphorylation and cell apoptosis by upregulating FoxO1.
CONCLUSION: The natural compound PB exhibited a protective effect in the AD cell 
model by increasing FoxO1 expression and reducing Tau phosphorylation and cell 
apoptosis.

BACKGROUND: Glyphosate is the most commonly used herbicide with potential 
neurotoxicity. However, limited epidemical evidence is found in the relationship 
between glyphosate and cognitive impairment, especially in the 
cognitive-disrupting sensitive elderly populations.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the association of urinary glyphosate 
exposure with cognitive impairment in the United State (US) older adults.
METHODS: Cognitive impairment was determined by the following four tests: the 
Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's disease (CERAD) Immediate 
Recall test (IR), the CERAD Delayed Recall tests (DR), the Animal Fluency (AF) 
test and the Digit Substitution test (DSST). Survey weighted logistic regression 
and restricted cubic splines were applied to evaluate and visualize the 
association between glyphosate and cognitive impairment.
RESULTS: A total of 465 elderly adults were identified in the National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013-2014 cycle, and among them, 
83.87% individuals had detectable urinary levels of glyphosate (0.628 ng/mL in 
average). After adjusting for the potential covariates, glyphosate was 
significantly linked to increased DR and AF impairment, and the corresponding 
ORs were 1.52 (1.01 to 2.30, p = 0.049) and 1.69 (1.11 to 2.59, p = 0.019), 
respectively. No significant association was identified between glyphosate and 
IR or DSST impairment. The RCS plot further confirmed the linear and positive 
relationships between glyphosate and DR and AF impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that exposure to glyphosate might be 
associated with declined cognitive function in the elderly, and it might be 
prudent to evaluate cognitive outcomes for aged individuals with glyphosate 
exposures.

The Apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) is of great interest due to its role as a risk 
factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. ApoE is secreted by astrocytes in the 
central nervous system in high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-like lipoproteins. 
Structural models of lipidated ApoE of high resolution could aid in a 
mechanistic understanding of how ApoE functions in health and disease. Using 
monoclonal Fab and F(ab')2 fragments, we characterize the structure of lipidated 
ApoE on astrocyte-secreted lipoproteins. Our results provide support for the 
"double-belt" model of ApoE in nascent discoidal HDL-like lipoproteins, where 
two ApoE proteins wrap around the nanodisc in an antiparallel conformation. We 
further show that lipidated, recombinant ApoE accurately models 
astrocyte-secreted ApoE lipoproteins. Cryogenic electron microscopy of 
recombinant lipidated ApoE further supports ApoE adopting antiparallel dimers in 
nascent discoidal lipoproteins.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) is a complex disease with 
multiple pathophysiological drivers that determine clinical symptomology and 
disease progression. These diseases develop insidiously over time, through many 
pathways and disease mechanisms and continue to have a huge societal impact for 
affected individuals and their families. While emerging blood-based biomarkers, 
such as plasma p-tau181 and p-tau217, accurately detect Alzheimer neuropthology 
and are associated with faster cognitive decline, the full extension of plasma 
proteomic changes in ADRD remains unknown. Earlier detection and better 
classification of the different subtypes may provide opportunities for earlier, 
more targeted interventions, and perhaps a higher likelihood of successful 
therapeutic development. In this study, we aim to leverage unbiased mass 
spectrometry proteomics to identify novel, blood-based biomarkers associated 
with cognitive decline. 1,786 plasma samples from 1,005 patients were collected 
over 12 years from partcipants in the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research 
Center Longitudinal Cohort Study. Patient metadata includes demographics, final 
diagnoses, and clinical dementia rating (CDR) scores taken concurrently. The 
Proteograph™ Product Suite (Seer, Inc.) and liquid-chromatography 
mass-spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis were used to process the plasma samples in 
this cohort and generate unbiased proteomics data. Data-independent acquisition 
(DIA) mass spectrometry results yielded 36,259 peptides and 4,007 protein 
groups. Linear mixed effects models revealed 138 differentially abundant 
proteins between AD and healthy controls. Machine learning classification models 
for AD diagnosis identified potential candidate biomarkers including MBP, BGLAP, 
and APoD. Cox regression models were created to determine the association of 
proteins with disease progression and suggest CLNS1A, CRISPLD2, and GOLPH3 as 
targets of further investigation as potential biomarkers. The Proteograph 
workflow provided deep, unbiased coverage of the plasma proteome at a speed that 
enabled a cohort study of almost 1,800 samples, which is the largest, deep, 
unbiased proteomics study of ADRD conducted to date.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an aging-related neurodegenerative disease, and the 
main pathological feature was β-amyloid protein (Aβ) deposition. Recently, 
bioactive materials-based drug delivery system has been widely investigated for 
the treatment of AD. In this study, we developed a red blood cells (RBC) 
membrane-coated polycaprolactone (PCL) nanoparticles (NPs) loading with a 
therapeutic agent for AD, curcumin (Cur). A functional peptide TGNYKALHPHN (TGN) 
was conjugated to the surface of membrane for blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
transport (TGN-RBC-NPs-Cur). TGN peptide can be recognized by receptors on the 
BBB and has great potential for brain transport. To confirm the targeted 
delivery of Cur to the brain, a cell co-culturing immortalized human cerebral 
microvascular endothelial cells and human brain astrocytes glioblastoma 
(hCMEC/D3 and U-118MG) in vitro model was established. As a result, the BBB 
transporting ratio of TGN-RBC-NPs-FITC was 29.64% at 12 h which was 
approximately eight-fold than RBC-NPs-FITC. The improvement of drug accumulation 
in the AD lesion was confirmed by the NPs modified with the BBB-penetrating 
peptide in the fluorescence imaging and quantitative analysis with UPLC-MS/MS in 
vivo. The neuroprotective effects were evaluated with new object recognition 
behavioral test, in vitro AD cell model, dendritic spine stain, GFAP and IBA1 
immunofluorescence stain. The spatial learning and memory abilities of the AD 
model mice treated with TGN-RBC-NPs-Cur were obviously enhanced compared with 
the AD control mice and were also better than Cur at the same dosage. These 
results were consistent with the values of protection index of rat adrenal 
pheochromocytoma cells (PC12 cells) treated by Aβ25-35. TGN-RBC-NPs-Cur 
increased the dendritic segments densities and restrained activation of 
microglia and astrocytes of AD mice, as well as reversed cognitive function of 
AD mice. All of the results demonstrated TGN-RBC-NPs-Cur a promising therapeutic 
strategy for delaying the progression of AD by designing biomimetic nanosystems 
to deliver drugs into the brain.

PURPOSE: The hippocampus is organized in subfields (HSF) involved in learning 
and memory processes and widely implicated in pathologies at different ages of 
life, from neonatal hypoxia to temporal lobe epilepsy or Alzheimer's disease. 
Getting a highly accurate and robust delineation of sub-millimetric regions such 
as HSF to investigate anatomo-functional hypotheses is a challenge. One of the 
main difficulties encountered by those methodologies is related to the small 
size and anatomical variability of HSF, resulting in the scarcity of manual data 
labeling. Recently introduced, capsule networks solve analogous problems in 
medical imaging, providing deep learning architectures with rotational 
equivariance. Nonetheless, capsule networks are still two-dimensional and 
unassessed for the segmentation of HSF.
APPROACH: We released a public 3D Capsule Network (3D-AGSCaps, 
https://github.com/clementpoiret/3D-AGSCaps) and compared it to equivalent 
architectures using classical convolutions on the automatic segmentation of HSF 
on small and atypical datasets (incomplete hippocampal inversion, IHI). We 
tested 3D-AGSCaps on three datasets with manually labeled hippocampi.
RESULTS: Our main results were: (1) 3D-AGSCaps produced segmentations with a 
better Dice Coefficient compared to CNNs on rotated hippocampi (p = 0.004, 
cohen's d = 0.179); (2) on typical subjects, 3D-AGSCaps produced segmentations 
with a Dice coefficient similar to CNNs while having 15 times fewer parameters 
(2.285M versus 35.069M). This may greatly facilitate the study of atypical 
subjects, including healthy and pathological cases like those presenting an IHI.
CONCLUSION: We expect our newly introduced 3D-AGSCaps to allow a more accurate 
and fully automated segmentation on atypical populations, small datasets, as 
well as on and large cohorts where manual segmentations are nearly intractable.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Tele-Savvy is a synchronous/asynchronous 
psychoeducation program for caregivers of community-dwelling persons living with 
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) designed to increase 
caregivers' competence and confidence (mastery) in caregiving. Its overall 
efficacy was tested in a randomized controlled trial.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This secondary data analysis examined the caregiver 
mastery and psychological health (i.e., perceived stress, depressive symptoms, 
and burden) outcome of 153 non-Hispanic Black American and White caregivers (31 
non-Hispanic Black American and 122 White caregivers) from baseline to 6 months 
postintervention. Given the difference in the sample sizes of Black and White 
caregivers, a descriptive post hoc subgroup analysis was conducted of 21 
non-Hispanic Black American and 20 White adult children and grandchildren 
caregivers.
RESULTS: In the overall sample, Black American caregivers demonstrated higher 
levels of mastery and lower levels of distress than White caregivers at baseline 
and across all time points. Over time, White caregivers, but not Black American 
caregivers, experienced significantly improved levels of mastery and 
significantly lowered levels of depression. Within the subgroup analysis, except 
for a moderate effect size in the management of situation scores over time among 
Black American adult children caregivers, similar results were obtained.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The findings highlight the strengths and 
shortcomings of the Tele-Savvy program in improving caregiver mastery and 
reducing negative psychological health outcomes. Intentionally tailoring the 
Tele-Savvy program to certain racial and caregiving groups may hold promise in 
meeting the needs of more ADRD caregivers.

BACKGROUND: The understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been dominated by 
the amyloid hypothesis. However, therapies targeting beta-amyloid have largely 
failed, generating interest in other potential pathogenic factors including 
energy metabolism.
OBJECTIVES: To interrogate canonical energy metabolism pathways from human 
prefrontal cortical tissue samples obtained from necropsy comparing AD and 
control.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Postmortem pre-frontal cortical tissue from 
10 subjects histologically diagnosed with AD and 10 control (CTRL) subjects was 
subjected to untargeted metabolomics to interrogate energy metabolism pathways. 
The samples were matched by age, sex, and post-mortem interval. Metabolite 
Measurements: Untargeted metabolomics analyses were via Metabolon®.
RESULTS: Glucose-derived energy metabolites in the glycolytic and pentose 
phosphate pathway and the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate were uniformly decreased 
in AD brain vs. CTRL brain.
CONCLUSION: This pilot study aimed to identify energy metabolism abnormalities 
using untargeted brain metabolomics in two independent subject cohorts. Our 
study revealed a pattern of global energy deficit in AD brain, supporting a 
growing body of evidence of deficient energy metabolism in AD.

Chronic pain leads to tau accumulation and hippocampal atrophy in mice. In this 
study, we provide one of the first assessments in humans, examining the 
associations of probable chronic pain with hippocampal volume, integrity of the 
locus coeruleus (LC)-an upstream site of tau deposition-and Alzheimer's 
Disease-related plasma biomarkers. Participants were mostly cognitively 
unimpaired men. Probable chronic pain was defined as moderate-to-severe pain in 
2+ study waves at average ages 56, 62, and 68. At age 68, 424 participants 
underwent structural magnestic resonance imaging (MRI) of hippocampal volume and 
LC-sensitive MRI providing an index of LC integrity (LC contrast-to-noise 
ratio). Analyses adjusted for confounders including major health conditions, 
depressive symptoms, and opioid use. Models showed that men with probable 
chronic pain had smaller hippocampal volume and lower rostral-middle-but not 
caudal-LC contrast-to-noise ratio compared to men without probable chronic pain. 
Men with probable chronic pain also had higher levels of plasma total tau, 
beta-amyloid-42, and beta-amyloid-40 compared to men without probable chronic 
pain. These findings suggest that probable chronic pain is associated with tau 
accumulation and reduced structural brain integrity in regions affected early in 
the development of Alzheimer's Disease. PERSPECTIVE: Probable chronic pain was 
associated with plasma biomarkers and brain regions that are affected early in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Reducing pain in midlife and elucidating biological 
mechanisms may help to reduce the risk of AD in older adults.

The molecular causes and mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases remain poorly 
understood. A growing number of single-cell studies have implicated various 
neural, glial, and immune cell subtypes to affect the mammalian central nervous 
system in many age-related disorders. Integrating this body of transcriptomic 
evidence into a comprehensive and reproducible framework poses several 
computational challenges. Here, we introduce ZEBRA, a large single-cell and 
single-nucleus RNA-seq database. ZEBRA integrates and normalizes gene expression 
and metadata from 33 studies, encompassing 4.2 million human and mouse brain 
cells sampled from 39 brain regions. It incorporates samples from patients with 
neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and 
Multiple sclerosis, as well as samples from relevant mouse models. We employed 
scVI, a deep probabilistic auto-encoder model, to integrate the samples and 
curated both cell and sample metadata for downstream analysis. ZEBRA allows for 
cell-type and disease-specific markers to be explored and compared between 
sample conditions and brain regions, a cell composition analysis, and gene-wise 
feature mappings. Our comprehensive molecular database facilitates the 
generation of data-driven hypotheses, enhancing our understanding of mammalian 
brain function during aging and disease. The data sets, along with an 
interactive database are freely available at

OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the scientific evidence on the relationship 
between periodontitis and neurological disease, and particularly cerebrovascular 
disease and dementia. We also issue a series of recommendations regarding the 
prevention and management of periodontitis and these neurological diseases at 
dental clinics and neurology units.
DEVELOPMENT: In response to a series of questions proposed by the SEPA-SEN 
working group, a literature search was performed, with no restrictions on study 
design, to identify the most relevant articles on the association between 
periodontitis and cerebrovascular disease and dementia from the perspectives of 
epidemiology, treatment, and the biological mechanisms involved in these 
associations.
CONCLUSIONS: Periodontitis increases the risk of ischaemic stroke and Alzheimer 
dementia. Recurrent bacterial infections and increased low-grade systemic 
inflammation seem to be possible biological mechanisms underlying this 
association. Limited evidence suggests that various oral health interventions 
can reduce the future risk of cerebrovascular disease and dementia.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered the leading cause of dementia in the 
elderly worldwide. It results in progressive memory loss and impairment of 
cognitive and motor skills, leading to a high degree of disability and 
dependence. The development of AD is associated with the accumulation of senile 
plaques in the brain, caused by the amyloidogenic pathway of the disease. 
Several genetic and biochemical events are linked to AD development, with 
oxidative stress being one of them. Due to the scarcity of drugs aimed at 
treating AD, antioxidant compounds are increasingly studied as therapeutic 
targets for the disease. In this study, we investigate the antioxidant and 
anti-Alzheimer potential of the Tetragonisca angustula (Jataí) pollen extract in 
a Drosophila melanogaster Alzheimer's model. For this purpose, we utilized a D. 
melanogaster AD-like model, which expresses genes related to the amyloidogenic 
pathway of Alzheimer's disease. We explored the floral origin of the collected 
pollen, conducted phytochemical prospecting, and evaluated its antioxidant 
capacity in vitro. In vivo experiments involved assessing the survival and 
climbing ability of the D. melanogaster AD-like model with various 
concentrations of the pollen extract. Our findings revealed that the pollen 
extract of Tetragonisca angustula exhibits a significant antioxidant response 
and high concentrations of important phytochemicals, such as flavonoids and 
polyphenols. Furthermore, it enhanced the survival rate of D. melanogaster, and 
across all concentrations tested, it improved the climbing ability of the flies 
after 15 days of treatment with methanolic pollen extract. Additionally, the 
pollen extract reduced the neurodegeneration index in histopathological 
analysis. Thus, our study demonstrates the potential of Tetragonisca angustula 
pollen as an important subject for further investigation, aiming to isolate 
molecules that could potentially serve as therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's 
disease.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease is a prominent neurodegenerative 
disorder characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss. Variations in 
subjective cognitive decline among Alzheimer's patients, often reported by 
caregiver, may stem from cultural, socioeconomic, healthcare access, and genetic 
factors. This study investigates racial disparities in subjective cognitive 
decline reported by caregivers and their implications.
METHODS: In this study, data from 12,627 Alzheimer's caretakers from the CDC's 
Alzheimer's Disease and Healthy Aging Data Portal were analyzed using JMP 
software. Caregivers reported patients' cognitive decline for various racial 
categories: Asian/Pacific Islander, Black, Hispanic, Native American/Native 
Alaskan, and White. Fit model tests and distribution analyses were employed to 
assess disparities in symptom severity. The study focused on four key questions 
regarding symptom prevalence and healthcare communication to assess the degree 
of symptoms the patients were experiencing.
RESULTS: Significant disparities in symptom severity reported by Alzheimer's 
caretakers were observed among the racial groups analyzed. The symptom severity 
ranked from least to most severe is the following: White, Asian/Pacific 
Islander, Black, Native American/Native Alaskan, and Hispanic patients. There 
was variance when it came to communication with healthcare providers, as the 
Asian population had the lowest communication rates. These findings underscore 
the need for targeted interventions considering cultural differences. It is 
important that tailoring healthcare approaches for different racial backgrounds 
is happening as a remedy to this gap in communication.
CONCLUSION: Due to cultural, socioeconomic, genetic factors, and others, there 
were significant observed disparities. Tailoring interventions to these diverse 
populations is crucial to address these inequities.

It is long been suggested that one-carbon metabolism (OCM) is associated with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), whereas the potential mechanisms remain poorly 
understood. Taking advantage of chemical biology, that mitochondrial serine 
hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT2) directly regulated the translation of ADAM 
metallopeptidase domain 10 (ADAM10), a therapeutic target for AD is reported. 
That the small-molecule kenpaullone (KEN) promoted ADAM10 translation via the 5' 
untranslated region (5'UTR) and improved cognitive functions in APP/PS1 mice is 
found. SHMT2, which is identified as a target gene of KEN and the 
5'UTR-interacting RNA binding protein (RBP), mediated KEN-induced ADAM10 
translation in vitro and in vivo. SHMT2 controls AD signaling pathways through 
binding to a large number of RNAs and enhances the 5'UTR activity of ADAM10 by 
direct interaction with GAGGG motif, whereas this motif affected ribosomal 
scanning of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) in the 5'UTR. Together, KEN 
exhibits therapeutic potential for AD by linking OCM with RNA processing, in 
which the metabolic enzyme SHMT2 "moonlighted" as RBP by binding to GAGGG motif 
and promoting the 5'UTR-dependent ADAM10 translation initiation.

BACKGROUND: Previous observational studies suggested an association between 
sepsis and neurodegenerative diseases, but causality remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: Determining the causal association between sepsis and four 
neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Lewy body dementia) through bidirectional 
two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.
METHODS: Genome-wide association study summary statistics for all traits were 
obtained from publicly available databases. Inverse variance weighted (IVW) was 
the primary method for evaluating causal associations. In addition, three 
additional MR methods (MR-Egger, weighted median, and maximum likelihood method) 
were employed to supplement IVW. Furthermore, various sensitivity tests were 
conducted to assess the reliability: 1) Cochrane's Q test for assessing 
heterogeneity; 2) MR-Egger intercept test and MR-PRESSO global test for 
evaluating horizontal pleiotropy; 3) leave-one-out sensitivity test for 
determining the stability.
RESULTS: The results of IVW indicated that sepsis significantly increased the 
risk of Alzheimer's disease (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.01-1.21, p = 0.025). In 
addition, three additional MR methods suggested parallel results. However, no 
causal effect of sepsis on the three other neurodegenerative diseases was 
identified. Subsequently, reverse MR analysis indicated that the four 
neurodegenerative diseases do not causally affect sepsis. Furthermore, 
sensitivity tests demonstrated the reliability of the MR analyses, suggesting no 
heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study contributes to a deeper comprehension of the 
intricate interplay between sepsis and neurodegenerative disorders, thereby 
offering potential avenues for the development of therapeutic agents that can 
effectively mitigate the multifarious complications associated with sepsis.

Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) plays a critical role 
in microglial activation, survival, and apoptosis, as well as in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) pathogenesis. We previously reported the MS4A locus as a key 
modulator for soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). To identify 
additional novel genetic modifiers of sTREM2, we performed the largest 
genome-wide association study (GWAS) and identified four loci for CSF sTREM2 in 
3,350 individuals of European ancestry. Through multi-ethnic fine mapping, we 
identified two independent missense variants (p.M178V in MS4A4A and p.A112T in 
MS4A6A) that drive the association in MS4A locus and showed an epistatic effect 
for sTREM2 levels and AD risk. The novel TREM2 locus on chr 6 contains two rare 
missense variants (rs75932628 p.R47H, P=7.16×10-19; rs142232675 p.D87N, 
P=2.71×10-10) associated with sTREM2 and AD risk. The third novel locus in the 
TGFBR2 and RBMS3 gene region (rs73823326, P=3.86×10-9) included a regulatory 
variant with a microglia-specific chromatin loop for the promoter of TGFBR2. 
Using cell-based assays we demonstrate that overexpression and knock-down of 
TGFBR2, but not RBMS3, leads to significant changes of sTREM2. The last novel 
locus is located on the APOE region (rs11666329, P=2.52×10-8), but we 
demonstrated that this signal was independent of APOE genotype. This signal 
colocalized with cis-eQTL of NECTIN2 in the brain cortex and cis-pQTL of NECTIN2 
in CSF. Overexpression of NECTIN2 led to an increase of sTREM2 supporting the 
genetic findings. To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date aimed at 
identifying genetic modifiers of CSF sTREM2. This study provided novel insights 
into the MS4A and TREM2 loci, two well-known AD risk genes, and identified 
TGFBR2 and NECTIN2 as additional modulators involved in TREM2 biology.

BACKGROUND: Dementia is a multifactorial disease, with Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
and vascular pathology often co-occurring in many individuals with dementia. 
Yet, the interplay between AD and vascular pathology in cognitive decline is 
largely undetermined.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to examine the joint effect of 
arteriosclerosis and AD pathology on cognition in the general population without 
dementia.
METHODS: We determined the interaction between blood-based AD biomarkers and 
CT-defined arteriosclerosis on cognition in 2,229 dementia-free participants of 
the population-based Rotterdam Study (mean age: 68.9 years, 52% women) 
cross-sectionally.
RESULTS: Amyloid-β (Aβ)42 and arterial calcification were associated with 
cognitive performance. After further adjustment for confounders in a model that 
combined all biomarkers, only arterial calcification remained independently 
associated with cognition. There was a significant interaction between arterial 
calcification and Aβ42 and between arterial calcification and the ratio of 
Aβ42/40. Yet, estimates attenuated, and interactions were no longer 
statistically significant after adjustment for cardio metabolic risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Arteriosclerosis and AD display additive interaction-effects on 
cognition in the general population, that are due in part to cardio metabolic 
risk factors. These findings suggest that joint assessment of arteriosclerosis 
and AD pathology is important for understanding of disease etiology in 
individuals with cognitive impairment.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Patients with diverticular disease (DD) have ongoing chronic 
inflammation associated with changes in the gut microbiome, which might 
contribute to the development of dementia.
METHODS: Using Danish medical and administrative registries from 1980 to 2013, 
we conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study including all DD 
patients and a matched (5:1) general population comparison cohort without DD. A 
nested case-control analysis was then conducted using a risk set sampling, 
matching four DD controls without dementia to each DD patient with dementia. 
Clinical severity was categorized as uncomplicated DD (outpatient), 
conservatively treated DD (inpatient), and surgically treated DD.
RESULTS: 149 527 DD patients and 747 635 general population comparators were 
identified. The 30-year cumulative incidence of dementia among DD patients and 
general population comparators were 12.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 
12.1-12.7) and 13.73% (95% CI 13.6-13.9), respectively. This corresponded to a 
30-year hazard ratio (HR) of 1.10 (95% CI 1.1-1.1). The highest HRs were found 
in the conservatively treated DD group (1.15 95% CI 1.1-1.2) and the group with 
young onset of DD (1.52 95% CI 1.2-2.0). In the nested case-control analysis, we 
identified 8875 dementia cases and 35 491 matched controls. The adjusted odds 
ratio (OR) for conservatively treated DD was increased (1.08, 95% CI; 1.0-1.2) 
compared to the reference of uncomplicated DD.
CONCLUSIONS: We observed a slight increased risk of dementia in patients with 
young onset DD and conservatively treated DD. Findings suggest an association 
between disease duration, perhaps reflecting the duration of gut inflammation, 
and the risk of developing dementia.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is heterogenous at the molecular level. Understanding 
this heterogeneity is critical for AD drug development. Here we define AD 
molecular subtypes using mass spectrometry proteomics in cerebrospinal fluid, 
based on 1,058 proteins, with different levels in individuals with AD (n = 419) 
compared to controls (n = 187). These AD subtypes had alterations in protein 
levels that were associated with distinct molecular processes: subtype 1 was 
characterized by proteins related to neuronal hyperplasticity; subtype 2 by 
innate immune activation; subtype 3 by RNA dysregulation; subtype 4 by choroid 
plexus dysfunction; and subtype 5 by blood-brain barrier impairment. Each 
subtype was related to specific AD genetic risk variants, for example, subtype 1 
was enriched with TREM2 R47H. Subtypes also differed in clinical outcomes, 
survival times and anatomical patterns of brain atrophy. These results indicate 
molecular heterogeneity in AD and highlight the need for personalized medicine.

BACKGROUND: Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is associated with Alzheimer's 
disease, which goes into a cycle of latency and reactivation. The present study 
was envisaged to understand the reasons for latency and specific molecular 
patterns present in the HSV-1.
OBJECTIVE: The objective is the molecular dissection of Herpes simplex virus 
type 1 to elucidate molecular mechanisms behind latency and compare its codon 
usage patterns with genes modulated during Alzheimer's disease as a part of 
host-pathogen interaction.
METHODS: In the present study, we tried to investigate the potential reasons for 
the latency of HSV-1 virus bioinformatically by determining the CpG patterns. 
Also, we investigated the codon usage pattern, the presence of rare codons, 
codon context, and protein properties.
RESULTS: The top 222 codon pairs graded based on their frequency in the HSV-1 
genome revealed that with only one exception (CUG-UUU), all other codon pairs 
have codons ending with G/C. Considering it an extension of host-pathogen 
interaction, we compared HSV-1 codon usage with that of codon usage of genes 
modulated during Alzheimer's disease, and we found that CGT and TTT are only two 
codons that exhibited similar codon usage patterns and other codons showed 
statistically highly significant different codon preferences. Dinucleotide CpG 
tends to mutate to TpG, suggesting the presence of mutational forces and the 
imperative role of CpG methylation in HSV-1 latency.
CONCLUSIONS: Upon comparison of codon usage between HSV-1 and Alzheimer's 
disease genes, no similarities in codon usage were found as a part of 
host-pathogen interaction. CpG methylation plays an imperative role in latency 
HSV-1.

Gray matter (GM) alterations play a role in aging-related disorders like 
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, yet MRI studies mainly focus on 
macroscopic changes. Although reliable indicators of atrophy, morphological 
metrics like cortical thickness lack the sensitivity to detect early changes 
preceding visible atrophy. Our study aimed at exploring the potential of 
diffusion MRI in unveiling sensitive markers of cortical and subcortical 
age-related microstructural changes and assessing their associations with 
cognitive and behavioral deficits. We leveraged the Human Connectome 
Project-Aging cohort that included 707 unimpaired participants (394 female; 
median age = 58, range = 36-90 years) and applied the powerful mean apparent 
diffusion propagator model to measure microstructural parameters, along with 
comprehensive behavioral and cognitive test scores. Both macro- and 
microstructural GM characteristics were strongly associated with age, with 
widespread significant microstructural correlations reflective of cellular 
morphological changes, reduced cellular density, increased extracellular volume, 
and increased membrane permeability. Importantly, when correlating MRI and 
cognitive test scores, our findings revealed no link between macrostructural 
volumetric changes and neurobehavioral performance. However, we found that 
cellular and extracellular alterations in cortical and subcortical GM regions 
were associated with neurobehavioral performance. Based on these findings, it is 
hypothesized that increased microstructural heterogeneity and decreased neurite 
orientation dispersion precede macrostructural changes, and that they play an 
important role in subsequent cognitive decline. These alterations are suggested 
to be early markers of neurocognitive performance that may distinctly aid in 
identifying the mechanisms underlying phenotypic aging and subsequent 
age-related functional decline.

fully understood. We compared mean age-trajectories of weight between those who 
did and did not develop late-onset-AD, and evaluated impact of age at maximum 
weight (AgeMax), and slope of decline in weight, on AD risk. Women with 
late-onset-AD had lower weight three or more decades before AD onset, and ∼10 
years younger AgeMax, compared to AD-free women. APOE4 carriers had younger 
AgeMax and steeper slope. Older AgeMax and flatter slope predicted lower AD 
risk. Premature decline in weight could be a sign of accelerated physical aging 
contributing to AD.

BACKGROUND: Hyperactive neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) (i.e., agitation, 
disinhibition, and irritability) are among the most challenging symptoms to 
manage in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, their underlying brain correlates 
have been poorly studied.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the associations between the total score of 
hyperactive NPS and brain structures in participants with AD, mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), and cognitively normal older adults (CN).
METHODS: Neuropsychiatric and 3T MRI data from 216 AD, 564 MCI, and 660 CN 
participants were extracted from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
database. To define NPS and brain structures' associations, we fitted a general 
linear model (GLM) in two ways: 1) an overall GLM including all three groups 
(AD, MCI, CN) and 2) three pair-wise GLMs (AD versus MCI, MCI versus CN, AD 
versus CN). The cortical changes as a function of NPS total score were 
investigated using multiple regression analyses.
RESULTS: Results from the overall GLM include associations between 1) agitation 
and the right parietal supramarginal surface area in the MCI-CN contrast, 2) 
disinhibition and the cortical thickness of the right frontal pars opercularis 
and temporal inferior in the AD-MCI contrast, and 3) irritability and the right 
frontal pars opercularis, frontal superior, and temporal superior volumes in the 
MCI-CN contrast.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that each hyperactive NPS is associated with 
distinct brain regions in AD, MCI, and CN (groups with different levels of 
cognitive performance). This suggests that each NPS is associated with a unique 
signature of brain morphology, including variations in volume, thickness, or 
area.

Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent degradation pathway essential for cellular 
homeostasis, which decreases with age. However, it is unclear how aging induces 
autophagy decline. Here we show the role of protein S-palmitoylation in 
autophagy. We identify the palmitoyl acyltransferase DHHC5 as a regulator of 
autophagy by mediating the palmitoylation of beclin 1, which in turn promotes 
the formation of ATG14L-containing class III phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase 
complex I and its lipid kinase activity by promoting the hydrophobic 
interactions between beclin 1 and adapter proteins ATG14L and VPS15. In aging 
brains of human and nonhuman primate, the levels of DHHC5 exhibit a marked 
decrease in expression. We show that DHHC5 deficiency in neurons leads to 
reduced cellular protein homeostasis in two established murine models of 
Alzheimer's disease, which exaggerates neurodegeneration in an 
autophagy-dependent manner. These findings identify reduction of DHHC5-mediated 
beclin 1 S-palmitoylation as an underlying mechanism by which aging induces 
autophagy decline.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disease of the brain worldwide. 
Currently, there is no effective cure. But accurate and early diagnosis of AD is 
critical to the development of patient care and future treatments. MiRNA-16 has 
been considered as an effective diagnostic biomarker for AD because of its 
regulatory effect on key proteins of AD. Herein, a colorimetric lateral flow 
assay (LFA) was developed for sensitive detection of miRNA-16 based on 
entropy-driven catalysis (EDC) amplification strategy. MiRNA-16 triggered EDC 
and released more linker DNAs (LDNA) of sandwich structure. Thus, AuNPs were 
enriched at the T-line to enhance the colorimetric signal and improve the 
sensitivity of visual assay. It showed good specificity and sensitivity for 
detecting miRNA-16 with a detection limit of 1.01 pM. The practical detection of 
miRNA-16 in human serum obtained satisfactory result. Significantly, EDC 
achieved signal amplification in homogeneous solution without enzyme and DNA 
labeling, leading to a cheap and easy detection of miRNA-16. Therefore, it 
provided a portable and rapid assay for AD-related nucleic acid, which holds a 
potential for point-of-care testing (POCT) of AD.

Update of
    Res Sq. 2023 Apr 18;:

Breakdown of the neurovascular unit is associated with blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
leakiness contributing to cognitive decline and disease pathology in the early 
stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Vascular stability depends on angiopoietin-1 
(ANGPT-1) signalling, antagonised by angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT-2) expressed upon 
endothelial injury. We examined the relationship between CSF ANGPT-2 and CSF 
markers of BBB leakiness and core AD biomarkers across three independent 
cohorts: (i) 31 AD patients and 33 healthy controls grouped according to their 
biomarker profile (i.e., AD cases t-tau > 400 pg/mL, p-tau > 60 pg/mL and 
Aβ42 < 550 pg/mL); (ii) 121 participants in the Wisconsin Registry for 
Alzheimer's Prevention or Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research study (84 
participants cognitively unimpaired (CU) enriched for a parental history of AD, 
20 participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 17 with AD); (iii) a 
neurologically normal cohort aged 23-78 years with paired CSF and serum samples. 
CSF ANGPT-2, sPDGFRβ, albumin and fibrinogen levels were measured by sandwich 
ELISA. In cohort (i), CSF ANGPT-2 was elevated in AD and correlated with CSF 
t-tau and p-tau181 but not Aβ42. ANGPT-2 also correlated positively with CSF 
sPDGFRβ and fibrinogen - markers of pericyte injury and BBB leakiness. In cohort 
(ii), CSF ANGPT-2 was highest in MCI and correlated with CSF albumin in the CU 
and MCI cohorts but not in AD. CSF ANGPT-2 also correlated with CSF t-tau and 
p-tau and with markers of neuronal injury (neurogranin and α-synuclein) and 
neuroinflammation (GFAP and YKL-40). In cohort (iii), CSF ANGPT-2 correlated 
strongly with the CSF/serum albumin ratio. Serum ANGPT-2 showed non-significant 
positive associations with CSF ANGPT-2 and the CSF/serum albumin ratio. 
Together, these data indicate that CSF and possibly serum ANGPT-2 is associated 
with BBB leakiness in early AD and is closely related to tau pathology and 
neuronal injury. The utility of serum ANGPT-2 as a biomarker of BBB damage in AD 
requires further study.

BACKGROUND: The association of body mass index (BMI) with cognition and 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers of the elderly remains inconclusive.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between BMI and cognition as well as 
AD biomarkers in the elderly with different cognitive status.
METHODS: Participants with cognitively normal (CN) were included as the CN 
group. Participants with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia were 
included as the cognitive impairment (CI) group. The relationship between BMI 
and AD biomarkers (cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 and p-tau181, hippocampal volume 
[HV]), global cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]), memory, and 
executive function were explored.
RESULTS: In the CI group, BMI was associated with MMSE (β= 0.03, p = 0.009), 
Aβ42 (β= 0.006, p = 0.029), p-tau181/Aβ42 ratio (β= -0.001, p = 0.011), and HV 
(β= 0.05, p < 0.001). However in the CN group, BMI exhibited associations with 
p-tau181 (β= 0.012, p = 0.014) and memory composite score (β= -0.04, p = 0.038), 
but not with p-tau181/Aβ42 ratio and HV. Moreover, mediation analysis showed 
that in the CI group, the positive effect of BMI on HV and MMSE score was 
partially mediated by diastolic blood pressure.
CONCLUSION: The association of BMI with cognition and AD biomarkers varies 
across different cognitive status. In particular, a lower BMI was associated 
with worse cognition, higher Aβ burden, and lower HV in individuals with CI. 
Clinical practice should strengthen the monitoring and management of BMI in 
patients with AD.

OBJECTIVE: Most neurodegenerative dementias present with substantial overlap in 
clinical features. Therefore, differential diagnosis is often a challenging task 
necessitating costly and sometimes invasive diagnostic procedures. A promising, 
non-invasive and cost-effective method is the widely available 
electroencephalography (EEG).
METHODS: Twenty-three subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 28 subjects with 
dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), 15 subjects with frontotemporal dementias 
(FTDs), and 22 healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. Nineteen channel 
computerized EEG recordings were acquired. Mean relative powers were calculated 
using the standard frequency bands. Theta/alpha ratio (TAR), theta/beta ratio 
(TBR), a spectral index of (alpha + beta)/(theta + delta) and an alpha 
reactivity index (alpha in eyes-open condition/alpha in eyes-closed condition) 
were also calculated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were 
performed to assess diagnostic accuracy.
RESULTS: For the comparison of EEG measures across groups, we performed a 
multivariate ANOVA followed by univariate ANOVAs controlling for the effects of 
age, with post hoc tests. Theta power and TBR were increased in DLB compared to 
other groups. Alpha power was decreased in DLB compared to HC and FTD; and in AD 
compared to FTD. Beta power was decreased in DLB compared to AD and HC. 
Furthermore, regional analyses demonstrated a unique pattern of theta power 
increase in DLB; affecting frontal, central, parietal, occipital, and temporal 
regions. In AD, theta power increased compared to HC in parietal, occipital, and 
right temporal regions. TAR was increased in DLB compared to other groups; and 
in AD compared to HC. Finally, alpha reactivity index was higher in DLB compared 
to HC and FTD. In AD, EEG slowing was associated with cognitive impairment, 
while in DLB, this was associated with higher DLB characteristics. In the ROC 
analyses to distinguish DLB from FTD and AD, measures of EEG slowing yielded 
high area under curve values, with good specificities. Also, decreased alpha 
reactivity could distinguish DLB from FTD with good specificity. EEG slowing in 
DLB showed a diffuse pattern compared to AD, where a posterior and temporal 
slowing predominated.
CONCLUSION: We showed that EEG slowing was satisfactory in distinguishing DLB 
patients from AD and FTD patients. Notably, this slowing was a characteristic 
finding in DLB patients, even at early stages, while it paralleled disease 
progression in AD. Furthermore, EEG slowing in DLB showed a diffuse pattern 
compared to AD, where a posterior and temporal slowing predominated. These 
findings align with the previous evidence of the diencephalic dysfunction in 
DLB.

Calcium is a ubiquitous second messenger that is indispensable in regulating 
neurotransmission and memory formation. A precise intracellular calcium level is 
achieved through the concerted action of calcium channels, and calcium exerts 
its effect by binding to an array of calcium-binding proteins, including 
calmodulin (CAM), calcium-calmodulin complex-dependent protein kinase-II 
(CAMK-II), calbindin (CAL), and calcineurin (CAN). Calbindin orchestrates a 
plethora of signaling events that regulate synaptic transmission and 
depolarizing signals. Vitamin D, an endogenous fat-soluble metabolite, is 
synthesized in the skin upon exposure to ultraviolet B radiation. It modulates 
calcium signaling by increasing the expression of the calcium-sensing receptor 
(CaSR), stimulating phospholipase C activity, and regulating the expression of 
calcium channels such as TRPV6. Vitamin D also modulates the activity of 
calcium-binding proteins, including CAM and calbindin, and increases their 
expression. Calbindin, a high-affinity calcium-binding protein, is involved in 
calcium buffering and transport in neurons. It has been shown to inhibit 
apoptosis and caspase-3 activity stimulated by presenilin 1 and 2 in AD. Whereas 
CAM, another calcium-binding protein, is implicated in regulating 
neurotransmitter release and memory formation by phosphorylating CAN, CAMK-II, 
and other calcium-regulated proteins. CAMK-II and CAN regulate actin-induced 
spine shape changes, which are further modulated by CAM. Low levels of both 
calbindin and vitamin D are attributed to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. 
Further research on vitamin D via calbindin-CAMK-II signaling may provide newer 
insights, revealing novel therapeutic targets and strategies for treatment.

Numerous researches have shown that the human brain organizes as a continuum 
axis crossing from sensory motor to transmodal cortex. Functional network 
alterations were commonly found in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Whether the 
hierarchy of AD brain networks has changed and how these changes related to gene 
expression profiling and cognition is unclear. Using resting-state functional 
magnetic resonance imaging data from 233 subjects (185 AD patients and 48 
healthy controls), we studied the changes in the functional network gradients in 
AD. Moreover, we investigated the relationships between gradient alterations and 
cognition, and gene expression profiling, respectively. We found that the second 
gradient organizes as a continuum axis crossing from the sensory motor to the 
transmodal cortex. Compared to the healthy controls, the secondary gradient 
scores of the visual and somatomotor network (SOM) increased significantly in 
AD, and the secondary gradient scores of default mode and frontoparietal network 
decreased significantly in AD. The secondary gradient scores of SOM and salience 
network (SAL) significantly positively correlated with memory function in AD. 
The secondary gradient in SAL also significantly positively correlated with 
language function. The AD-related second gradient alterations were spatially 
associated with the gene expression and the relevant genes enriched in 
neurobiology-related pathways, specially expressed in various tissues, cell 
types, and developmental stages. These findings suggested the changes in the 
functional network gradients in AD and deepened our understanding of the 
correlation between macroscopic gradient structure and microscopic gene 
expression profiling in AD.

We analyzed Lewy body (LB) pathology in 18 autosomal dominant Alzheimer's 
disease (ADAD) brains via immunohistochemistry. Real-time quaking induced 
conversion was used to detect misfolded α-synuclein (α-syn) in 18 living ADAD 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. Concomitant LB pathology was present in 44% 
ADAD brains. Only 6% CSF samples were positive for misfolded α-syn. In an 
additional AD sample, all patients with confirmed LB presented misfolded α-syn 
in postmortem CSF regardless of the LB staging. In conclusion, misfolded α-syn 
in CSF was scarce in symptomatic living ADAD individuals, in contrast to 
postmortem brain tissue. These results suggest late appearance of LB pathology 
in ADAD.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to examine and compare the 
dementia-related discourse and language used by people with mild neurocognitive 
disorder (MND), their family members, and family caregivers of people with 
Alzheimer's disease in Israel and Germany.
DESIGN: This secondary qualitative analysis included focus groups and 
semistructured interviews. Thematic analysis was used to reveal the main 
discourses and stigmatic language used regarding dementia and people with 
dementia.
SETTING: Israeli and German stakeholders.
PARTICIPANTS: Forty-four Israeli and 44 German participants: 28 people with MND, 
20 family members of people with MND, and 40 family caregivers of people with 
Alzheimer's disease.
RESULTS: Two main discourses were identified: the tragedy and the biomedical 
discourse. The tragedy discourse included several subthemes: "Dementia as the 
worst-case scenario," "Nothing can be done about dementia," and "People with 
dementia are not human." The biomedical discourse stressed pathologic aspects of 
the condition. Similarities and differences were found between Israeli and 
German participants.
CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that, despite culture and language differences, 
the use of stigmatic discourse and stigmatizing language is common among people 
with close exposure to dementia in Israel and Germany. Efforts should be 
increased to develop a person-centered and dementia-friendly language.

Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is the most common cause of dementia among 
those older than 65 years. The onset of LOAD is influenced by neuroinflammation. 
The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system is involved in regulating inflammatory 
responses. Numerous HLA alleles and their haplotypes have shown varying 
associations with LOAD in diverse populations, yet their impact on the Japanese 
population remains to be elucidated. Here, we conducted a comprehensive 
investigation into the associations between LOAD and HLA alleles within the 
Japanese population. Using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from 303 LOAD 
patients and 1717 cognitively normal (CN) controls, we identified four-digit HLA 
class I alleles (A, B, and C) and class II alleles (DRB1, DQB1, and DPB1). We 
found a significant association between the HLA-DRB1*09:01-DQB1*03:03 haplotype 
and LOAD risk in APOE [Formula: see text]4-negative samples (odds ratio = 1.81, 
95% confidence interval = 1.38-2.38, P = 2.03[Formula: see text]). These alleles 
not only showed distinctive frequencies specific to East Asians but demonstrated 
a high degree of linkage disequilibrium in APOE [Formula: see text]4-negative 
samples (r2 = 0.88). Because HLA class II molecules interact with T-cell 
receptors (TCRs), we explored potential disparities in the diversities of TCR α 
chain (TRA) and β chain (TRB) repertoires between APOE [Formula: see 
text]4-negative LOAD and CN samples. Lower diversity of TRA repertoires was 
associated with LOAD in APOE [Formula: see text]4-negative samples, irrespective 
of the HLA DRB1*09:01-DQB1*03:03 haplotype. Our study enhances the understanding 
of the etiology of LOAD in the Japanese population and provides new insights 
into the underlying mechanisms of its pathogenesis.

The drug development pipeline for a new compound can last 10-20 years and cost 
over $10 billion. Drug repurposing offers a more time- and cost-effective 
alternative. Computational approaches based on network graph representations, 
comprising a mixture of disease nodes and their interactions, have recently 
yielded new drug repurposing hypotheses, including suitable candidates for 
COVID-19. However, these interactomes remain aggregate by design and often lack 
disease specificity. This dilution of information may affect the relevance of 
drug node embeddings to a particular disease, the resulting drug-disease and 
drug-drug similarity scores, and therefore our ability to identify new targets 
or drug synergies. To address this problem, we propose constructing and learning 
disease-specific hypergraphs in which hyperedges encode biological pathways of 
various lengths. We use a modified node2vec algorithm to generate pathway 
embeddings. We evaluate our hypergraph's ability to find repurposing targets for 
an incurable but prevalent disease, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and compare our 
ranked-ordered recommendations to those derived from a state-of-the-art 
knowledge graph, the multiscale interactome. Using our method, we successfully 
identified 7 promising repurposing candidates for AD that were ranked as 
unlikely repurposing targets by the multiscale interactome but for which the 
existing literature provides supporting evidence. Additionally, our drug 
repositioning suggestions are accompanied by explanations, eliciting plausible 
biological pathways. In the future, we plan on scaling our proposed method to 
800+ diseases, combining single-disease hypergraphs into multi-disease 
hypergraphs to account for subpopulations with risk factors or encode a given 
patient's comorbidities to formulate personalized repurposing 
recommendations.Supplementary materials and code:

BACKGROUND: While epidemiologic evidence links higher levels of exposure to fine 
particulate matter (PM2.5) to decreased cognitive function, fewer studies have 
investigated links with traffic-related air pollution (TRAP), and none have 
examined ultrafine particles (UFP, ≤100 nm) and late-life dementia incidence.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate associations between TRAP exposures (UFP, black carbon 
[BC], and nitrogen dioxide [NO2]) and late-life dementia incidence.
METHODS: We ascertained dementia incidence in the Seattle-based Adult Changes in 
Thought (ACT) prospective cohort study (beginning in 1994) and assessed ten-year 
average TRAP exposures for each participant based on prediction models derived 
from an extensive mobile monitoring campaign. We applied Cox proportional 
hazards models to investigate TRAP exposure and dementia incidence using age as 
the time axis and further adjusting for sex, self-reported race, calendar year, 
education, socioeconomic status, PM2.5, and APOE genotype. We ran sensitivity 
analyses where we did not adjust for PM2.5 and other sensitivity and secondary 
analyses where we adjusted for multiple pollutants, applied alternative exposure 
models (including total and size-specific UFP), modified the adjustment 
covariates, used calendar year as the time axis, assessed different exposure 
periods, dementia subtypes, and others.
RESULTS: We identified 1,041 incident all-cause dementia cases in 4,283 
participants over 37,102 person-years of follow-up. We did not find evidence of 
a greater hazard of late-life dementia incidence with elevated levels of 
long-term TRAP exposures. The estimated hazard ratio of all-cause dementia was 
0.98 (95 % CI: 0.92-1.05) for every 2000 pt/cm3 increment in UFP, 0.95 
(0.89-1.01) for every 100 ng/m3 increment in BC, and 0.96 (0.91-1.02) for every 
2 ppb increment in NO2. These findings were consistent across sensitivity and 
secondary analyses.
DISCUSSION: We did not find evidence of a greater hazard of late-life dementia 
risk with elevated long-term TRAP exposures in this population-based prospective 
cohort study.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is accompanied by behavioral and psychological symptoms 
of dementia (BPSD), which is often alleviated by treatment with psychotropic 
drugs, such as antidepressants, hypnotics, and anxiolytics. If these drugs also 
inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, they may contribute to the 
suppression of AD progression by increasing brain acetylcholine concentrations. 
We tested the potential inhibitory effects of 31 antidepressants, 21 hypnotics, 
and 12 anxiolytics on recombinant human AChE (rhAChE) activity. At a 
concentration of 10-4 M, 22 antidepressants, 19 hypnotics, and 11 anxiolytics 
inhibited rhAChE activity by <20%, whereas nine antidepressants (clomipramine, 
amoxapine, setiptiline, nefazodone, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, 
escitalopram, and mirtazapine), two hypnotics (triazolam and brotizolam), and 
one anxiolytic (buspirone) inhibited rhAChE activity by ≥20%. Brotizolam (≥10-6 
M) exhibited stronger inhibition of rhAChE activity than the other drugs, with 
its pIC50 value being 4.57 ± 0.02. The pIC50 values of the other drugs were <4, 
and they showed inhibitory activities toward rhAChE at the following 
concentrations: ≥3 × 10-6 M (sertraline and buspirone), ≥10-5 M (amoxapine, 
nefazodone, paroxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, mirtazapine, and triazolam), 
and ≥3 × 10-5 M (clomipramine and setiptiline). Among these drugs, only 
nefazodone inhibited rhAChE activity within the blood concentration range 
achievable at clinical doses. Therefore, nefazodone may not only improve the 
depressive symptoms of BPSD through its antidepressant actions but also slow the 
progression of cognitive symptoms of AD through its AChE inhibitory actions.

Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and both positive 
and negative associations of individual inflammation-related markers with brain 
structure and cognitive function have been described. We aimed to identify 
inflammatory signatures of CSF immune-related markers that relate to changes of 
brain structure and cognition across the clinical spectrum ranging from normal 
aging to AD. A panel of 16 inflammatory markers, Aβ42/40 and p-tau181 were 
measured in CSF at baseline in the DZNE DELCODE cohort (n = 295); a longitudinal 
observational study focusing on at-risk stages of AD. Volumetric maps of gray 
and white matter (GM/WM; n = 261) and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs, 
n = 249) were derived from baseline MRIs. Cognitive decline (n = 204) and the 
rate of change in GM volume was measured in subjects with at least 3 visits 
(n = 175). A principal component analysis on the CSF markers revealed four 
inflammatory components (PCs). Of these, the first component PC1 (highly loading 
on sTyro3, sAXL, sTREM2, YKL-40, and C1q) was associated with older age and 
higher p-tau levels, but with less pathological Aβ when controlling for p-tau. 
PC2 (highly loading on CRP, IL-18, complement factor F/H and C4) was related to 
male gender, higher body mass index and greater vascular risk. PC1 levels, 
adjusted for AD markers, were related to higher GM and WM volumes, less WMHs, 
better baseline memory, and to slower atrophy rates in AD-related areas and less 
cognitive decline. In contrast, PC2 related to less GM and WM volumes and worse 
memory at baseline. Similar inflammatory signatures and associations were 
identified in the independent F.ACE cohort. Our data suggest that there are 
beneficial and detrimental signatures of inflammatory CSF biomarkers. While 
higher levels of TAM receptors (sTyro/sAXL) or sTREM2 might reflect a protective 
glia response to degeneration related to phagocytic clearance, other markers 
might rather reflect proinflammatory states that have detrimental impact on 
brain integrity.

and identified predictors for dementia in AF patients.
METHODS: The analysis was based on 183,610 patients with new-onset AF and 
367,220 non-AF controls in the United Kingdom between 1998 and 2016, identified 
in three prospectively collected, linked electronic health records sources. 
Time-to-event (dementia or subtypes) analyses were performed using Cox 
proportional hazards and weighted Cox. Sub-analyses performed: including & 
censoring stroke and age (median used as cut-off).
RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 2.67 years (IQR .65-6.02) for AF patients 
and 5.84 years for non-AF patients (IQR 2.26-11.80), incidence of dementia in 
the AF cohort was 2.65 per 100 person-years, compared to 2.02 in the non-AF 
cohort. After adjustment, a significant association was observed between AF and 
all-cause dementia (HR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.31-1.45), driven by a strong 
association with VaD (HR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.41-1.70). AF was also associated with 
mixed dementia (HR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.01-1.56), but we could not confirm an 
association with Alzheimer (HR = 1.05, 95% CI: .94-1.16) and rare dementia forms 
(HR = 1.19, 95% CI: .90-1.56). Ischemic stroke (HR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.26-1.56), 
subarachnoid haemorrhage (HR = 2.08, 95% CI: 1.47-2.96), intracerebral 
haemorrhage (HR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.54-2.48) and diabetes (HR = 1.32, 95% CI: 
1.24-1.41) were identified as the strongest predictors of dementia in AF 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: AF patients have an increased risk of dementia, independent of 
stroke, with highest risk of VaD. Management and prevention of the identified 
risk factors could be crucial to reduce the increasing burden of dementia.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias are progressive 
neurological disorders with stage-specific clinical features and challenges. An 
important knowledge gap is the "window of time" within which patients transition 
from mild cognitive impairment or mild AD to moderate or severe AD. Better 
characterization/establishment of transition times would help clinicians 
initiating treatments, including anti-amyloid therapy.
OBJECTIVE: To describe cognitive test score-based AD stage transitions in 
Veterans with AD in the US Veterans Affairs Healthcare System (VAHS).
METHODS: This retrospective analysis (2010-2019) identified Veterans with AD 
from the VAHS Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes. AD stage was based on 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), or 
Saint Louis University Mental Status (SLUMS) Examination scores in the EHR.
RESULTS: We identified 296,519 Veterans with cognitive test-based AD staging. 
Over the 10-year study, the proportion of veterans with MMSE scores declined 
from 24.9% to 9.5% while those with SLUMS rose from 9.0% to 17.8%; and MoCA rose 
from 5.0% to 25.4%. The average forward transition times between each stage were 
approximately 2-4 years, whether assessed by MMSE, MoCA, or SLUMS.
CONCLUSION: The average transition time for cognitive test-based assessments of 
initial cognitive decline, early-stage AD, and moderate/severe AD in the VAHS is 
2-4 years. In view of the short window for introducing disease-modifying therapy 
and the significant benefits of early treatment of AD, our data suggest a 
critical need for treatment guidelines in the management of AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by 
neuronal cell death and memory impairment. Corticosterone (CORT) is a 
glucocorticoid hormone produced by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in 
response to a stressful condition. Excessive stress and high CORT levels are 
known to cause neurotoxicity and aggravate various diseases, whereas mild stress 
and low CORT levels exert beneficial actions under pathophysiological 
conditions. However, the effects of mild stress on AD have not been clearly 
elucidated yet. In this study, the effects of low (3 and 30 nM) CORT 
concentration on Aβ25-35-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells and underlying 
molecular mechanisms have been investigated. Cytotoxicity caused by Aβ25-35 was 
significantly inhibited by the low concentration of CORT treatment in the cells. 
Furthermore, CORT pretreatment significantly reduced Aβ25-35-mediated 
pro-apoptotic signals, such as increased Bim/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 cleavage. 
Moreover, low concentration of CORT treatment inhibited the Aβ25-35-induced 
cyclooxygenase-2 and pro-inflammatory cytokine expressions, including tumor 
necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β. Aβ25-35 resulted in intracellular 
accumulation of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation, which were 
effectively reduced by the low CORT concentration. As a molecular mechanism, low 
CORT concentration activated the nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2, a 
redox-sensitive transcription factor mediating cellular defense and upregulating 
the expression of antioxidant enzymes, such as NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase, 
glutamylcysteine synthetase, and manganese superoxide dismutase. These findings 
suggest that low CORT concentration exerts protective actions against 
Aβ25-35-induced neurotoxicity and might be used to treat and/or prevent AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, multifactorial 
neurodegenerative disease. However, the pathogenesis remains unclear. Recently, 
an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that ferroptosis is a new type 
of iron-dependent programmed cell death, contributes to the death of nerve cells 
in AD. By controlling iron homeostasis and mitochondrial function, the 
particular protein called frataxin (FXN), which is situated in the mitochondrial 
matrix, is a critical regulator of ferroptosis disease. It is encoded by the 
nuclear gene FXN. Here, we identified a novel underlying mechanism through which 
ferroptosis mediated by FXN contributes to AD.
METHODS: Human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) were injured by L-glutamate 
(L-Glu). Overexpression of FXN by lentiviral transfection. In each experimental 
group, we assessed the ultrastructure of the mitochondria, the presence of iron 
and intracellular Fe2 + , the levels of reactive oxygen species, the 
mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and lipid peroxidation. Quantification 
was done for malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH), as well as 
reactive oxygen species (ROS). Western blot and cellular immunofluorescence 
assays were used to detect the expression of xCT and GPX4 proteins which in 
System Xc-/GPX4 pathway, and the protein expressions of ACSL4 and TfR1 were 
investigated by Western blot.
RESULTS: The present work showed: (1) The expression of FXN was reduced in the 
L-Glu group; (2) Compared with the Control group, MMP was reduced in the L-Glu 
group, and mitochondria were observed to shrink and cristae were deformed, 
reduced or disappeared by transmission electron microscopy, and after FXN 
overexpression and ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) (10 μmol/L) intervened, MMP was 
increased and mitochondrial morphology was significantly improved, suggesting 
that mitochondrial function was impaired in the L-Glu group, and overexpression 
of FXN could improve the manifestation of mitochondrial function impairment. (3) 
In the L-Glu group, ROS, MDA, iron ion concentration and Fe2+ levels were 
increased, GSH was decreased. Elevated expression of ACSL4 and TfR1, important 
regulatory proteins of ferroptosis, was detected by Western blot, and the 
expression of xCT and GPX4 in the System Xc-/GPX4 pathway was reduced by Western 
blot and cellular immunofluorescence. However, the above results were reversed 
when FXN overexpression and Fer-1 intervened.
CONCLUSION: To conclude, our research demonstrates that an elevated expression 
of FXN effectively demonstrates a robust neuroprotective effect against 
oxidative damage induced by L-Glu. Moreover, it mitigates mitochondrial 
dysfunction and lipid metabolic dysregulation associated with ferroptosis. FXN 
overexpression holds promise in potential therapeutic strategies for AD by 
inhibiting ferroptosis in nerve cells and fostering their protection.

BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a clinically and pathologically 
heterogeneous condition with a prevalence comparable to Alzheimer's Disease for 
patients under sixty-five years of age. Gray matter (GM) atrophy and glucose 
hypometabolism are important biomarkers for the diagnosis and evaluation of 
disease progression in FTD. However, limited studies have systematically 
examined the association between cognition and neuroimaging in FTD using 
different imaging modalities in the same patient group.
METHODS: We examined the association of cognition using Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment (MoCA) with both GM volume and glucose metabolism using structural 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission 
tomography scanning ([18F]FDG PET) in 21 patients diagnosed with FTD. 
Standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) using the brainstem as a reference region 
was the primary outcome measure for [18F]FDG PET. Partial volume correction was 
applied to PET data to account for disease-related atrophy.
RESULTS: Significant positive associations were found between whole-cortex GM 
volume and MoCA scores (r = 0.461, p = 0.035). The association between 
whole-cortex [18F]FDG SUVR and MoCA scores was not Significant (r = 0.374, p = 
0.094). GM volumes of the frontal cortex (r = 0.540, p = 0.011), caudate (r = 
0.616, p = 0.002), and insula (r = 0.568, p = 0.007) were also Significantly 
correlated with MoCA, as were SUVR values of the insula (r = 0.508, p = 0.018), 
thalamus (r = 0.478, p = 0.028), and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) (r = 
0.472, p = 0.030).
DISCUSSION: Whole-cortex atrophy is associated with cognitive dysfunction, and 
this effect is larger than for cortical hypometabolism as measured with [18F]FDG 
PET. At the regional level, focal atrophy and/or hypometabolism in the frontal 
lobe, insula, PCC, thalamus, and caudate seem to imply the importance of these 
regions for the decline of cognitive function in FTD. Furthermore, these results 
highlight how functional and structural changes may not overlap and might 
contribute to cognitive dysfunction in FTD in different ways. Our findings 
provide insight into the relationships between structural, metabolic, and 
cognitive changes due to FTD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a major dementia cause, lacks effective 
treatment. MRI-based hippocampal volume measurement using artificial 
intelligence offers new insights into early diagnosis and intervention in AD 
progression.
OBJECTIVE: This study, involving 483 AD patients, 756 patients with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI), and 968 normal controls (NC), investigated the 
predictive capability of MRI-based hippocampus volume measurements for AD risk 
using artificial intelligence and evidence-based medicine.
METHODS: Utilizing data from ADNI and OASIS-brains databases, three 
convolutional neural networks (InceptionResNetv2, Densenet169, and SEResNet50) 
were employed for automated AD classification based on structural MRI imaging. A 
multitask deep learning model and a densely connected 3D convolutional network 
were utilized. Additionally, a systematic meta-analysis explored the value of 
MRI-based hippocampal volume measurement in predicting AD occurrence and 
progression, drawing on 23 eligible articles from PubMed and Embase databases.
RESULTS: InceptionResNetv2 outperformed other networks, achieving 99.75% 
accuracy and 100% AUC for AD-NC classification and 99.16% accuracy and 100% AUC 
for MCI-NC classification. Notably, at a 512×512 size, InceptionResNetv2 
demonstrated a classification accuracy of 94.29% and an AUC of 98% for AD-NC and 
97.31% accuracy and 98% AUC for MCI-NC.
CONCLUSIONS: The study concludes that MRI-based hippocampal volume changes 
effectively predict AD onset and progression, facilitating early intervention 
and prevention.

BACKGROUND: Antibody-based immunoassays have enabled quantification of very low 
concentrations of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein forms in cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF), aiding in the diagnosis of AD. Mass spectrometry enables absolute 
quantification of multiple p-tau variants within a single run. The goal of this 
study was to compare the performance of mass spectrometry assessments of 
p-tau181, p-tau217 and p-tau231 with established immunoassay techniques.
METHODS: We measured p-tau181, p-tau217 and p-tau231 concentrations in CSF from 
173 participants from the TRIAD cohort and 394 participants from the BioFINDER-2 
cohort using both mass spectrometry and immunoassay methods. All subjects were 
clinically evaluated by dementia specialists and had amyloid-PET and tau-PET 
assessments. Bland-Altman analyses evaluated the agreement between immunoassay 
and mass spectrometry p-tau181, p-tau217 and p-tau231. P-tau associations with 
amyloid-PET and tau-PET uptake were also compared. Receiver Operating 
Characteristic (ROC) analyses compared the performance of mass spectrometry and 
immunoassays p-tau concentrations to identify amyloid-PET positivity.
RESULTS: Mass spectrometry and immunoassays of p-tau217 were highly comparable 
in terms of diagnostic performance, between-group effect sizes and associations 
with PET biomarkers. In contrast, p-tau181 and p-tau231 concentrations measured 
using antibody-free mass spectrometry had lower performance compared with 
immunoassays.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that while similar overall, immunoassay-based 
p-tau biomarkers are slightly superior to antibody-free mass spectrometry-based 
p-tau biomarkers. Future work is needed to determine whether the potential to 
evaluate multiple biomarkers within a single run offsets the slightly lower 
performance of antibody-free mass spectrometry-based p-tau quantification.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and the 
predominant type of dementia worldwide. It is characterized by the progressive 
and irreversible decline of cognitive functions. In addition to the pathological 
beta-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, glial activation, and neuronal injury in the 
postmortem brains of AD patients, increasing evidence suggests that the often 
overlooked vascular dysfunction is an important early event in AD 
pathophysiology. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a critical role 
in regulating physiological functions and pathological changes in blood vessels, 
but whether VEGF is involved in the early stage of vascular pathology in AD 
remains unclear.
METHODS: We used an antiangiogenic agent for clinical cancer treatment, the 
humanized monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab, to block VEGF binding to 
its receptors in the 5×FAD mouse model at an early age. After treatment, memory 
performance was evaluated by a novel object recognition test, and cerebral 
vascular permeability and perfusion were examined by an Evans blue assay and 
blood flow scanning imaging analysis. Immunofluorescence staining was used to 
measure glial activation and Aβ deposits. VEGF and its receptors were analyzed 
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting. RNA sequencing was 
performed to elucidate bevacizumab-associated transcriptional signatures in the 
hippocampus of 5×FAD mice.
RESULTS: Bevacizumab treatment administered from 4 months of age dramatically 
improved cerebrovascular functions, reduced glial activation, and restored 
long-term memory in both sexes of 5×FAD mice. Notably, a sex-specific change in 
different VEGF receptors was identified in the cortex and hippocampus of 5×FAD 
mice. Soluble VEGFR1 was decreased in female mice, while full-length VEGFR2 was 
increased in male mice. Bevacizumab treatment reversed the altered expression of 
receptors to be comparable to the level in the wild-type mice. Gene Set 
Enrichment Analysis of transcriptomic changes revealed that bevacizumab 
effectively reversed the changes in the gene sets associated with blood-brain 
barrier integrity and vascular smooth muscle contraction in 5×FAD mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated the mechanistic roles of VEGF at the early 
stage of amyloidopathy and the protective effects of bevacizumab on 
cerebrovascular function and memory performance in 5×FAD mice. These findings 
also suggest the therapeutic potential of bevacizumab for the early intervention 
of AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's dementia (AD) pathogenesis involves complex mechanisms, 
including microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation. Integrative network and machine 
learning analysis of miRNA can provide insights into AD pathology and 
prognostic/diagnostic biomarkers.
METHODS: We performed co-expression network analysis to identify network modules 
associated with AD, its neuropathology markers, and cognition using brain tissue 
miRNA profiles from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project 
(ROS/MAP) (N = 702) as a discovery dataset. We performed association analysis of 
hub miRNAs with AD, its neuropathology markers, and cognition. After selecting 
target genes of the hub miRNAs, we performed association analysis of the hub 
miRNAs with their target genes and then performed pathway-based enrichment 
analysis. For replication, we performed a consensus miRNA co-expression network 
analysis using the ROS/MAP dataset and an independent dataset (N = 16) from the 
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Furthermore, we performed a machine learning 
approach to assess the performance of hub miRNAs for AD classification.
RESULTS: Network analysis identified a glucose metabolism pathway-enriched 
module (M3) as significantly associated with AD and cognition. Five hub miRNAs 
(miR-129-5p, miR-433, miR-1260, miR-200a, and miR-221) of M3 had significant 
associations with AD clinical and/or pathologic traits, with miR129-5p by far 
the strongest across all phenotypes. Gene-set enrichment analysis of target 
genes associated with their corresponding hub miRNAs identified significantly 
enriched biological pathways including ErbB, AMPK, MAPK, and mTOR signaling 
pathways. Consensus network analysis identified two AD-associated consensus 
network modules and two hub miRNAs (miR-129-5p and miR-221). Machine learning 
analysis showed that the AD classification performance (area under the curve 
(AUC) = 0.807) of age, sex, and APOE ε4 carrier status was significantly 
improved by 6.3% with inclusion of five AD-associated hub miRNAs.
CONCLUSIONS: Integrative network and machine learning analysis identified miRNA 
signatures, especially miR-129-5p, as associated with AD, its neuropathology 
markers, and cognition, enhancing our understanding of AD pathogenesis and 
leading to better performance of AD classification as potential 
diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers.

The current demand for early intervention, prevention, and treatment of late 
onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) warrants deeper understanding of the underlying 
molecular processes which could contribute to biomarker and drug target 
discovery. Utilizing high-throughput proteomic measurements in serum from a 
prospective population-based cohort of older adults (n = 5,294), we identified 
303 unique proteins associated with incident LOAD (median follow-up 12.8 years). 
Over 40% of these proteins were associated with LOAD independently of APOE-ε4 
carrier status. These proteins were implicated in neuronal processes and 
overlapped with protein signatures of LOAD in brain and cerebrospinal fluid. We 
found 17 proteins which LOAD-association was strongly dependent on APOE-ε4 
carrier status. Most of them showed consistent associations with LOAD in 
cerebrospinal fluid and a third had brain-specific gene expression. Remarkably, 
four proteins in this group (TBCA, ARL2, S100A13 and IRF6) were downregulated by 
APOE-ε4 yet upregulated as a consequence of LOAD as determined in a 
bi-directional Mendelian randomization analysis, reflecting a potential response 
to the disease onset. Accordingly, the direct association of these proteins to 
LOAD was reversed upon APOE-ε4 genotype adjustment, a finding which we replicate 
in an external cohort (n = 719). Our findings provide an insight into the 
dysregulated pathways that may lead to the development and early detection of 
LOAD, including those both independent and dependent on APOE-ε4. Importantly, 
many of the LOAD-associated proteins we find in the circulation have been found 
to be expressed - and have a direct link with AD - in brain tissue. Thus, the 
proteins identified here, and their upstream modulating pathways, provide a new 
source of circulating biomarker and therapeutic target candidates for LOAD.

PURPOSE: To compare optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) retina 
metrics between cognitively healthy subjects with pathological versus normal 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ42/tau ratios.
METHODS: Swept-source OCTA scans were collected using the Zeiss PLEX Elite 9000 
and analyzed on 23 cognitively healthy (CH) subjects who had previously 
undergone CSF analysis. Thirteen subjects had a pathological Aβ42/tau (PAT) 
ratio of <2.7132, indicative of presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 10 
had a normal Aβ42/tau (NAT) ratio of ≥2.7132. OCTA en face images of the 
superficial vascular complex (SVC) and deep vascular complex were binarized and 
skeletonized to quantify the perfusion density (PD), vessel length density 
(VLD), and fractal dimension (FrD). The foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area was 
calculated using the SVC slab. Choriocapillaris flow deficits (CCFDs) were 
computed from the en face OCTA slab of the CC. The above parameters were 
compared between CH-PATs and CH-NATs.
RESULTS: Compared to CH-NATs, CH-PATs showed significantly decreased PD, VLD, 
and FrD in the SVC, with a significantly increased FAZ area and CCFDs.
CONCLUSIONS: Swept-source OCTA analysis of the SVC and CC suggests a significant 
vascular loss at the CH stage of pre-AD that might be an indicator of a 
neurodegenerative process initiated by the impaired clearance of Aβ42 in the 
blood vessel wall and by phosphorylated tau accumulation in the perivascular 
spaces, a process that most likely mirrors that in the brain. If confirmed in 
larger longitudinal studies, OCTA retinal and inner choroidal metrics may be 
important biomarkers for assessing presymptomatic AD.

BACKGROUND: Tau is a microtubule-binding protein encoded by the MAPT gene. Tau 
is essential for several physiological functions and associated with 
pathological processes, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Six tau isoforms are 
typically described in the central nervous system, but current research paints a 
more diverse landscape and a more nuanced balance between isoforms. Recent work 
has described tau isoforms generated by intron 11 and intron 12 retention. This 
work adds to that evidence, proving the existence of MAPT transcripts retaining 
intron 3. Our aim is to demonstrate the existence of mature MAPT RNA species 
that retain intron 3 in human brain samples and to study its correlation with 
Alzheimer's disease across different regions.
METHODS: Initial evidence of intron-3-retaining MAPT species come from in silico 
analysis of RNA-seq databases. We further demonstrate the existence of these 
mature RNA species in a human neuroepithelioma cell line and human brain samples 
by quantitative PCR. We also use digital droplet PCR to demonstrate the 
existence of RNA species that retain either intron 3, intron 12 or both introns.
FINDINGS: Intron-3-retaining species are even more prominently present that 
intron-12-retaining ones. We show the presence of MAPT transcripts that retain 
both introns 3 and 12. These intron-retaining species are diminished in brain 
samples of patients with Alzheimer's disease with respect to individuals without 
dementia. Conversely, relative abundance of intron-3- or intron-12-retaining 
MAPT species with respect to double-retaining species as well as their 
percentage of expression with respect to total MAPT are increased in patients 
with Alzheimer's disease, especially in hippocampal samples. Among these 
TIR-MAPT species, TIR3+12 double truncation allows better classification 
potential of Alzheimer's disease samples. Moreover, we find a significant 
increase in intron-3- or intron-12-retaining species and its relative abundance 
with respect to double-retaining MAPT species in cerebellum in contrast to 
frontal lateral cortex and hippocampus in individuals with no signs of dementia.
INTERPRETATION: Intron retention constitutes a potential mechanism to generate 
Tau isoforms whose mature RNA expression levels correlate with Alzheimer's 
pathology showing its potential as a biomarker associated to the disease.

Underdiagnosis, misdiagnosis, and patterns of social inequality that translate 
into unequal access to health systems all pose barriers to identifying and 
recruiting diverse and representative populations into research on Alzheimer's 
disease and Alzheimer's disease related dementias. In response, some have turned 
to algorithms to identify patients living with dementia using information that 
is associated with this condition but that is not as specific as a diagnosis. 
This paper explains six ethical issues associated with the use of such 
algorithms including the generation of new, sensitive, identifiable medical 
information for research purposes without participant consent, issues of justice 
and equity, risk, and ethical communication. It concludes with a discussion of 
strategies for addressing these issues and prompting valuable research.

BACKGROUND: The association between uric acid (UA) and cognitive function still 
remains controversial. Moreover, the role of inflammation in the above 
association is also unclear.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the association between UA and cognitive 
function among non-hyperuricemia adults, and in particular, whether the 
association was shaped by different inflammation levels.
METHODS: From the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), 7,272 
participants aged 45 and above were enrolled in 2011. Cognitive function 
measurement included orientation and attention, episodic memory, and 
visuospatial ability. Fasting blood samples were collected to measure levels of 
UA and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). Generalized estimating 
equation models were used to evaluate the effect of UA on cognitive function in 
all participants and those at different levels of hs-CRP (hs-CRP <3 mg/L or 
≥3 mg/L).
RESULTS: Among non-hyperuricemia adults (mean age: 58.08, 49.59% males) for a 
median of 7 years follow-up, participants with higher levels of UA had better 
cognitive function score compared to those with lower UA levels (β: 0.09, 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 0.01-0.17, p = 0.023). And this association was 
significant under low-grade inflammation levels condition (β:0.10, 95% CI: 
0.10-0.19, p = 0.024), but not in high-grade inflammation levels condition. 
Further, the cognitive function benefit of elevated UA existed only in people 
with persistent low-grade inflammation levels at a longitudinal perspective (β: 
0.14, 95% CI: 0.01-0.27, p = 0.039).
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated UA levels were associated with better cognitive function 
in non-hyperuricemia population, especially for those at low inflammation 
levels.

INTRODUCTION: Altered immune signatures are emerging as a central theme in 
neurodegenerative disease, yet little is known about immune responses in 
early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD).
METHODS: We examined single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and droplet digital (dd)PCR data from CD4 T 
cells from participants with EOAD and clinically normal controls.
RESULTS: We analyzed ~182,000 PBMCs by scRNA-seq and discovered increased 
interferon signaling-associated gene (ISAG) expression and striking expansion of 
antiviral-like ISAGhi T cells in EOAD. We isolated CD4 T cells from additional 
EOAD cases and confirmed increased expression of ISAGhi marker genes. Publicly 
available cerebrospinal fluid leukocyte scRNA-seq data from late-onset mild 
cognitive impairment and AD also revealed increased expression of 
interferon-response genes.
DISCUSSION: ISAGhi T cells, apparently primed for antiviral activity, are 
expanded in EOAD. Additional research into these cells and the role of 
heightened peripheral IFN signaling in neurodegeneration is warranted.

γ-secretase processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) has long been of 
interest in the pathological progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its 
role in the generation of amyloid-β. The catalytic component of the enzyme is 
the presenilins of which there are two homologues, Presenilin-1 (PS1) and 
Presenilin-2 (PS2). The field has focussed on the PS1 form of this enzyme, as it 
is typically considered the more active at APP processing. However, much of this 
work has been completed without appropriate consideration of the specific levels 
of protein expression of PS1 and PS2. We propose that expression is an important 
factor in PS1- and PS2-γ-secretase activity, and that when this is considered, 
PS1 does not have greater activity than PS2. We developed and validated tools 
for quantitative assessment of PS1 and PS2 protein expression levels to enable 
the direct comparison of PS in exogenous and endogenous expression systems, in 
HEK-293 PS1 and/or PS2 knockout cells. We show that exogenous expression of 
Myc-PS1-NTF is 5.5-times higher than Myc-PS2-NTF. Quantitating endogenous PS 
protein levels, using a novel PS1/2 fusion standard we developed, showed similar 
results. When the marked difference in PS1 and PS2 protein levels is considered, 
we show that compared to PS1-γ-secretase, PS2-γ-secretase has equal or more 
activity on APP and Notch1. This study has implications for understanding the 
PS1- and PS2-specific contributions to substrate processing, and their potential 
influence in AD pathogenesis.

Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 6 (PCSK6) is a calcium-dependent 
serine proteinase that regulates the proteolytic activity of various precursor 
proteins and facilitates protein maturation. Dysregulation of PCSK6 expression 
or function has been implicated in several pathological processes including 
nervous system diseases. However, whether and how PCSK6 is involved in the 
pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. In this study, we 
reported that the expression of PCSK6 was significantly increased in the brain 
tissues of postmortem AD patients and APP23/PS45 transgenic AD model mice, as 
well as N2AAPP cells. Genetic knockdown of PCSK6 reduced amyloidogenic 
processing of APP in N2AAPP cells by suppressing the activation of membrane-type 
5-matrix metalloproteinase (MT5-MMP), referred to as η-secretase. We further 
found that PCSK6 cleaved and activated MT5-MMP by recognizing the RRRNKR 
sequence in its N-terminal propeptide domain in N2A cells. The mutation or 
knockout of this cleavage motif prevented PCSK6 from interacting with MT5-MMP 
and performing cleavage. Importantly, genetic knockdown of PCSK6 with 
adeno-associated virus (AAV) reduced Aβ production and ameliorated hippocampal 
long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term spatial learning and memory in 
APP23/PS45 transgenic mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate that 
genetic knockdown of PCSK6 effectively alleviate AD-related pathology and 
cognitive impairments by inactivating MT5-MMP, highlighting its potential as a 
novel therapeutic target for AD treatment.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 217 has recently received 
attention because it seems more reliable than other p-tau variants for 
identifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Thus, we aimed to compare the 
diagnostic accuracy of plasma and CSF p-tau217 with p-tau181 and p-tau231 in a 
memory clinic cohort.
METHODS: The study included 114 participants (CU = 33; MCI = 67; Dementia = 14). 
The p-tau variants were correlated versus continuous measures of amyloid (A) and 
tau (T)-PET. The p-tau phospho-epitopes were assessed through: (i) effect sizes 
(δ) between diagnostic and A ± and T ± groups; (ii) receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) analyses in A-PET and T-PET.
RESULTS: The correlations between both plasma and CSF p-tau217 with A-PET and 
T-PET (r range 0.64-0.83) were stronger than those of p-tau181 (r range 
0.44-0.79) and p-tau231 (r range 0.46-0.76). Plasma p-tau217 showed 
significantly higher diagnostic accuracy than p-tau181 and p-tau231 in (i) 
differences between diagnostic and biomarker groups (δrange: 
p-tau217 = 0.55-0.96; p-tau181 = 0.51-0.67; p-tau231 = 0.53-0.71); (ii) ROC 
curves to identify A-PET and T-PET positivity (AUCaverage: p-tau217 = 0.96; 
p-tau181 = 0.76; p-tau231 = 0.79). On the other hand, CSF p-tau217 
(AUCaverage = 0.95) did not reveal significant differences in A-PET and T-PET 
AUC than p-tau181 (AUCaverage = 0.88) and p-tau231 (AUCaverage = 0.89).
DISCUSSION: Plasma p-tau217 demonstrated better performance in the 
identification of AD pathology and clinical phenotypes in comparison with other 
variants of p-tau in a memory clinic cohort. Furthermore, p-tau217 had 
comparable performance in plasma and CSF. Our findings suggest the potential of 
plasma p-tau217 in the diagnosis and screening for AD, which could allow for a 
decreased use of invasive biomarkers in the future.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with an increased risk of 
dementia and early features may become evident even in mid-life. Characterizing 
these early features comprehensively requires multiple measurement modalities 
and careful selection of participants with and without T2D.
OBJECTIVE: We conducted a cross-sectional multimodal imaging study of 
T2D-discordant twins in late mid-life to provide insights into underlying 
mechanisms.
METHODS: Measurements included computerized cognitive battery, brain MRI 
(including arterial spin labelling, diffusion tensor, resting state functional), 
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET, and retinal optical coherence tomography.
RESULTS: There were 23 pairs, mean age 63.7 (±6.1) years. In global analyses, 
T2D was associated with poorer attention (β= -0.45, p <0.001) and with reduced 
FDG uptake (β= -5.04, p = 0.02), but not with cortical thickness (p = 0.71), 
total brain volume (p = 0.51), fractional anisotropy (p = 0.15), mean 
diffusivity (p = 0.34), or resting state activity (p = 0.4). Higher FDG uptake 
was associated with better attention (β= 3.19, p = 0.01) but not with other 
cognitive domains. In regional analyses, T2D was associated with lower accumbens 
volume (β= -44, p = 0.0004) which was in turn associated with poorer attention.
CONCLUSION: T2D-related brain dysfunction in mid-life manifests as attentional 
loss accompanied by evidence of subtle neurodegeneration and global reduction in 
cerebral metabolism, in the absence of overt cerebrovascular disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, affecting 
approximately 45.0 million people worldwide and ranking as the fifth leading 
cause of mortality. AD is identified by neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which 
include abnormally phosphorylated tau-protein and amyloid protein (amyloid 
plaques). Peptide dysregulation is caused by an imbalance between the production 
and clearance of the amyloid-beta (Aβ) and NFT. AD begins to develop when these 
peptides are not cleared from the body. As a result, understanding the processes 
that control both normal and pathological protein recycling in neuronal cells is 
critical. Insufficient Aβ and NFT clearance are important factors in the 
development of AD. Autophagy, lysosomal dysfunction, and ubiquitin-proteasome 
dysfunction have potential roles in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative 
disorders, particularly in AD. Modulation of these pathways may provide a novel 
treatment strategy for AD. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have recently emerged as 
important biological regulators, with particular relevance to the emergence and 
development of neurodegenerative disorders such as AD. ncRNAs can be used as 
potential therapeutic targets and diagnostic biomarkers due to their critical 
regulatory functions in several biological processes involved in disease 
development, such as the aggregation and accumulation of Aβ and NFT. It is 
evident that ncRNAs play a role in the pathophysiology of AD. In this 
communication, we explored the link between ncRNAs and AD and their regulatory 
mechanisms that may help in finding new therapeutic targets and AD medications.

BACKGROUND: Alkaloids are important phytoconstituents obtained from various 
plant sources. The study's primary goal is to assess the anti-Alzheimer 
potential of alkaloids using a molecular docking study. Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
is considered a gradual decline in memory, reasoning, decision-making, 
orientation to one's physical surroundings, and language.
METHOD AND MATERIAL: The main target i.e. acetylcholinesterase proteins was 
selected for the molecular docking study.
RESULT: The structures of various alkaloids were drawn using Chem Draw Software, 
PDB was retrieved from the RCSB PDB database, and molecular docking study was 
performed on Molergo Virtual Docker. The potential alkaloids were identified 
with anti-Alzheimer potency.
CONCLUSION: Reserpine, vinblastine, ergotamine, and tubocurarine were found to 
exhibit potential anti-Alzheimer potency.

BACKGROUND: Future thinking and prospective memory are two cognitive processes 
oriented toward the future and reliant on the ability to envision oneself in 
future scenarios.
OBJECTIVE: We explored the connection between future thinking and prospective 
memory in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: We invited both AD participants and control participants to engage in 
event-based prospective memory tasks (e.g., "please hand me this stopwatch when 
I inform you there are 10 minutes remaining") and time-based prospective memory 
tasks (e.g., "close the book you are working on in five minutes"). Additionally, 
we asked participants to engage in a future thinking task where they imagined 
upcoming events.
RESULTS: Analysis revealed that AD participants exhibited lower performance in 
both prospective memory tasks and future thinking compared to the control group. 
Importantly, we identified significant positive correlations between the 
performance on event- and time-based prospective memory tasks and future 
thinking abilities among AD participants.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the connection between the decline in 
both prospective memory domains and the ability to envision future events in 
individuals with AD. Our results also shed light on the challenges AD 
individuals face when trying to project themselves into the future to mentally 
pre-experience upcoming events.

in the livers and intestines of p300 S89A knockin (S89AKI) mice. We now show 
that this mutation is also associated with brain metabolic defects and neuronal 
differentiation.
METHODS: p300 S89A edited P19 cells, and S89AKI mice demonstrated metabolic and 
neuronal differentiation defects based on proteomic, cell biological and PET 
imaging studies.
RESULTS: The metabolic and differentiation defects associated with the p300 S89A 
knockin mutation could be corrected both in vitro and in vivo utilizing the 
small molecule CBP/beta-catenin antagonist ICG-001.
CONCLUSION: Rebalancing the equilibrium between CBP/β-catenin versus 
p300/β-catenin associated transcription, utilizing the small molecule 
CBP/beta-catenin antagonist ICG-001, enhances mitochondrial oxidative 
phosphorylation, metabolic function, and neuronal differentiation and may be 
able to ameliorate the cognitive decline seen in neurodegenerative disorders, 
including Alzheimer's Disease.

BACKGROUND: While the amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (ATN) framework has found 
wide application in Alzheimer's disease research, it is unclear if thresholds 
obtained using distinct thresholding methods are concordant within the same 
dataset and interchangeable across cohorts.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the robustness of data-driven thresholding methods 
and ATN profiling across cohort datasets.
DESIGN AND SETTING: We evaluated the impact of thresholding methods on ATN 
profiles by applying five commonly-used methodologies across cohort datasets. We 
assessed the generalizability of disease patterns discovered within ATN profiles 
by clustering individuals from different cohorts who were assigned to the same 
ATN profile.
PARTICIPANTS AND MEASUREMENTS: Participants with available CSF amyloid-β 1-42, 
phosphorylated tau, and total tau measurements were included from eleven AD 
cohort studies.
RESULTS: We observed high variability among obtained ATN thresholds, both across 
methods and datasets that impacted the resulting profile assignments of 
participants significantly. Clustering participants from different cohorts 
within the same ATN category indicated that identified disease patterns were 
comparable across most cohorts and biases introduced through distinct 
thresholding and data representations remained insignificant in most ATN 
profiles.
CONLUSION: Thresholding method selection is a decision of statistical relevance 
that will inevitably bias the resulting profiling and affect its sensitivity and 
specificity. Thresholds are likely not directly interchangeable between 
independent cohorts. To apply the ATN framework as an actionable and robust 
profiling scheme, a comprehensive understanding of the impact of used 
thresholding methods, their statistical implications, and a validation of 
results is crucial.

BACKGROUND: Most people with dementia have multiple health conditions. This 
study explores (1) number and type of health condition(s) in people with 
dementia overall and in relation to age, sex, dementia type, and cognition; (2) 
change in number of health conditions over two years; and (3) whether over time 
the number of health conditions at baseline is related to social isolation, 
loneliness, quality of life, and/or well-being.
METHODS: Longitudinal data from the IDEAL (Improving the experience of Dementia 
and Enhancing Active Life) cohort were used. Participants comprised people with 
dementia (n = 1490) living in the community (at baseline) in Great Britain. 
Health conditions using the Charlson Comorbidity Index, cognition, social 
isolation, loneliness, quality of life, and well-being were assessed over two 
years. Mixed effects modelling was used.
RESULTS: On average participants had 1.8 health conditions at baseline, 
excluding dementia; increasing to 2.5 conditions over two years. Those with 
vascular dementia or mixed (Alzheimer's and vascular) dementia had more health 
conditions than those with Alzheimer's disease. People aged ≥ 80 had more health 
conditions than those aged < 65 years. At baseline having more health conditions 
was associated with increased loneliness, poorer quality of life, and poorer 
well-being, but was either minimally or not associated with cognition, sex, and 
social isolation. Number of health conditions had either minimal or no influence 
on these variables over time.
CONCLUSIONS: People with dementia in IDEAL generally had multiple health 
conditions and those with more health conditions were lonelier, had poorer 
quality of life, and poorer well-being.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Given the established racial disparities in both sleep health 
and dementia risk for African American populations, we assess cross-sectional 
and longitudinal associations of self-report sleep duration (SRSD) and daytime 
sleepiness with plasma amyloid beta (Aβ) and cognition in an African American 
(AA) cohort.
METHODS: In a cognitively unimpaired sample drawn from the African Americans 
Fighting Alzheimer's in Midlife (AA-FAiM) study, data on SRSD, Epworth 
Sleepiness Scale, demographics, and cognitive performance were analyzed. Aβ40, 
Aβ42, and the Aβ42/40 ratio were quantified from plasma samples. Cross-sectional 
analyses explored associations between baseline predictors and outcome measures. 
Linear mixed-effect regression models estimated associations of SRSD and daytime 
sleepiness with plasma Aβ and cognitive performance levels and change over time.
RESULTS: One hundred and forty-seven participants comprised the cross-sectional 
sample. Baseline age was 63.2 ± 8.51 years. 69.6% self-identified as female. 
SRSD was 6.4 ± 1.1 hours and 22.4% reported excessive daytime sleepiness. The 
longitudinal dataset included 57 participants. In fully adjusted models, neither 
SRSD nor daytime sleepiness is associated with cross-sectional or longitudinal 
Aβ. Associations with level and trajectory of cognitive test performance varied 
by measure of sleep health.
CONCLUSIONS: SRSD was below National Sleep Foundation recommendations and 
daytime sleepiness was prevalent in this cohort. In the absence of observed 
associations with plasma Aβ, poorer self-reported sleep health broadly predicted 
poorer cognitive function but not accelerated decline. Future research is 
necessary to understand and address modifiable sleep mechanisms as they relate 
to cognitive aging in AA at disproportionate risk for dementia.

BACKGROUND: 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) regulates 
intracellular cortisol and its inhibition by the small molecule inhibitor, 
Xanamem™, may provide a disease-modifying strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Animal models suggest a range of 30-60% enzyme inhibition may suffice to provide 
neuroprotection.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the regional brain occupancy of 11β-HSD1 by Xanamem™ in 
cognitively normal participants (CN) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/mild AD 
patients to investigate potential dosing ranges for future efficacy studies.
METHODS: Seventeen MCI/AD and 23 CN were included. Regional brain time-activity 
curves (TAC), standardized uptake values (SUV40-60) and volume of distribution 
(VT) from Logan plot with image derived input function from 11C-TARACT positron 
emission tomography (PET) were used to assess the degree of 11β-HSD1 occupancy 
by increasing doses of Xanamem™ (5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg or 30 mg daily for 7 days).
RESULTS: All measures showed high 11β-HSD1 occupancy with Xanamem to similar 
degree in CN and MCI/AD. The dose-response relationship was relatively flat 
above 5 mg. Respective median (interquartile range [Q1-Q3]) 11β-HSD1 occupancy 
in the MCI/AD and CN groups after treatment with 10 mg Xanamem were 80% [79-81%] 
and 75% [71-76%] in the neocortex, 69% [64-70%] and 61% [52-63%] in the medial 
temporal lobe, 80% [79-80%] and 73% [68-73%] in the basal ganglia, and 71% 
[67-75%] and 66% [62-68%] in the cerebellum.
CONCLUSIONS: TAC, SUV40-60, and VT measures indicate Xanamem achieves high 
target occupancy levels with near saturation at 10 mg daily. These data support 
exploration of doses of≤10 mg daily in future clinical studies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that involves 
progressive cognitive decline accompanied by synaptic degeneration and impaired 
neurotransmission. Recent studies revealed that apple pomace, a waste byproduct 
of the apple processing industry, has beneficial health properties, but its 
potential to prevent and treat AD has not been determined. Herein, we examined 
the effects of apple pomace extract on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist 
MK-801-induced memory impairment in mice. Repeated treatment with apple pomace 
extract for 7 days reversed the MK-801-induced impairment of associative memory 
and recognition memory. RNA sequencing revealed that repeated treatment with 
apple pomace extract altered the gene expression profile in the hippocampus of 
mice. Real-time PCR showed that apple pomace extract induced upregulation of the 
mRNA expression for Zfp125 and Gstp1. Furthermore, gene sets related to synapse 
and neurotransmission were upregulated by apple pomace extract. These findings 
indicate that apple pomace extract may be useful for the prevention and 
treatment of AD.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carotid artery stenosis or occlusion (CASO) is a 
causative disease of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) attributed to cerebral 
hypoperfusion, even without the development of symptomatic ischemic stroke. 
Preclinically, resveratrol has been demonstrated to play an important role in 
improving cognitive function in rodent CASO models. This study investigated the 
association between long-term resveratrol intake and improvements in cognitive 
and cerebral hemodynamic impairments in patients with CASO.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients with 
asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis of ≥50% or occlusion who underwent 15O-gas 
positron emission tomography (15O-gas PET) and neuropsychological tests such as 
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment 
Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13 (ADAS-Cog) twice between July 2020 and March 2022 
allowing >125-day interval. Patients were administered 30 mg/day resveratrol 
after the first 15O-gas PET and neuropsychological tests were compared with 
those who were not.
RESULTS: A total of 79 patients were enrolled in this study; 36 received 
resveratrol and 43 did not. Over a mean follow-up of 221.2 and 244.8 days, 
long-term resveratrol treatment significantly improved visuospatial/executive 
function (P=0.020) in MoCA, and memory domain (P=0.007) and total score 
(P=0.019) in ADAS-Cog. Cerebral blood flow demonstrated improvement in the right 
frontal lobe (P=0.027), left lenticular nucleus (P=0.009), right thalamus 
(P=0.035), and left thalamus (P=0.010) on 15O-gas PET. No adverse events were 
reported.
CONCLUSION: Long-term daily intake of oral resveratrol may prevent or treat VCI 
by improving the cerebral blood flow in asymptomatic patients with CASO.

BACKGROUND: Emotion and cognition are intercorrelated. Impaired emotion is 
common in populations with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), showing promises as an early detection approach.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to develop a novel automatic classification tool based on 
emotion features and machine learning.
METHODS: Older adults aged 60 years or over were recruited among residents in 
the long-term care facilities and the community. Participants included healthy 
control participants with normal cognition (HC, n = 26), patients with MCI 
(n = 23), and patients with probable AD (n = 30). Participants watched emotional 
film clips while multi-dimensional emotion data were collected, including mental 
features of Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM), physiological features of 
electrodermal activity (EDA), and facial expressions. Emotional features of EDA 
and facial expression were abstracted by using continuous decomposition analysis 
and EomNet, respectively. Bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) was 
used to train classification model. Hybrid fusion was used, including early 
feature fusion and late decision fusion. Data from 79 participants were utilized 
into deep machine learning analysis and hybrid fusion method.
RESULTS: By combining multiple emotion features, the model's performance of AUC 
value was highest in classification between HC and probable AD (AUC = 0.92), 
intermediate between MCI and probable AD (AUC = 0.88), and lowest between HC and 
MCI (AUC = 0.82).
CONCLUSIONS: Our method demonstrated an excellent predictive power to 
differentiate HC/MCI/AD by fusion of multiple emotion features. The proposed 
model provides a cost-effective and automated method that can assist in 
detecting probable AD and MCI from normal aging.

BACKGROUND: KHK6640 is a novel humanized anti-amyloid beta oligomer-specific 
antibody. Both KHK6640 and the mouse parent antibody E64 have demonstrated high 
potency and efficacy for cognitive improvement in several rodent Alzheimer's 
disease models, including an anti-amyloid beta injection mouse model and in 
age-matched double transgenic littermates. The favorable safety and 
pharmacokinetic profiles of KHK6640 reported in preclinical studies warrant 
clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease patients.
OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of 
intravenous and subcutaneous oligomer-specific antibody KHK6640 in treating 
patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease or mild to moderate Alzheimer's 
disease.
DESIGN: Phase I/2a, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
trial.
SETTING: Nine sites in Europe participated in this clinical trial.
PARTICIPANTS: 97 patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease or mild to moderate 
Alzheimer's disease.
INTERVENTION: Single and multiple ascending intravenous and subcutaneous doses 
of KHK6640 in doses ranging from 0.1 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg or placebo was 
administered to patients monthly for six months.
MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcomes were safety including amyloid-related imaging 
abnormalities for edema and hemorrhage, assessed with magnetic resonance 
imaging. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid samples were analyzed to investigate 
pharmacokinetics and KHK6640 effects on biomarkers. Cognition, brain glucose 
metabolism and amyloid load were exploratory outcomes.
RESULTS: No amyloid-related imaging abnormalities for edema were observed. 
Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities for hemorrhage were comparable to that of 
placebo and population background. KHK6640 exposure was approximately 
dose-equivalent, with a serum terminal elimination half-life of approximately 19 
days. KHK6640 pharmacokinetics in serum and cerebrospinal fluid, including 
cerebrospinal fluid oligomers trapped by the antibody were dose related. 
Positive trends seen in the positron emission tomography brain glucose 
metabolism and amyloid load, cerebrospinal tau but cognition assessments were 
inconclusive, due to low numbers.
CONCLUSIONS: KHK6640 was well-tolerated across all doses, without any 
amyloid-related imaging abnormalities for edema, and amyloid-related imaging 
abnormalities for hemorrhage was as population background. The demonstrated 
dose-response of specific target biomarkers provides dosing guidance on dose and 
administration method selection for further clinical development.

Non-invasive deep brain stimulation using transcranial magnetic stimulation is a 
promising technique for treating several neurological disorders, such as 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. However, the currently used coils do not 
demonstrate the required stimulation performance in deep regions of the brain, 
such as the hippocampus, due to the rapid decay of the field inside the head. 
This study proposes an array that uses the cone coil method for deep 
stimulation. This study investigates the impact of magnetic core and shielding 
on field strength, focality, decay rate, and safety. The coil's size and shape 
effects on the electric field distribution in deep brain areas are also 
examined. The finite element method is used to calculate the induced electric 
field in a realistic human head model. The simulation results indicate that the 
magnetic core and shielding increase the electric field intensity and enhance 
focality but do not improve the field decay rate. However, the decay rate can be 
reduced by increasing the coil size at the expense of focality. By adopting an 
optimum cone structure, the proposed five-coil array reduces the electric field 
attenuation rate to reach the stimulation threshold in deep regions while 
keeping all other regions within safety limits. In vitro and in vivo 
experimental results using a head phantom and a dead pig's head validate the 
simulated results and confirm that the proposed design is a reliable and 
efficient candidate for non-invasive deep brain magnetic stimulation.

Aluminum (Al) is a known neurotoxic trace element linked to Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, has shown promising effects in reducing 
neuroinflammation at lower doses than those prescribed for addiction. This study 
aimed to determine the neuroprotective effects of naltrexone on Al-induced 
neurotoxicity in an in vitro AD model. The SH-SY5Y cells were first cultivated 
in a standard growth medium. Subsequently, the cells were induced to 
differentiate by decreasing the concentration of fetal bovine serum and 
introducing retinoic acid (RA) into the culture media. Subsequently, the 
inclusion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was implemented in 
conjunction with RA. The process of differentiation was concluded on the seventh 
day. Study groups (n = 3) were designed as the control group, naltrexone group, 
Al group, Al-Nal group, Alzheimer' model (AD) group, Alzheimer 
model + Al-exposed group (AD-Al), Alzheimer model + Nal applied group (AD-Nal) 
and Alzheimer model + Al-exposed + Nal applied group (AD-Al-Nal). 
Hyperphosphorylated Tau protein as the specific marker of AD was measured in all 
groups. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3)β, Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), Akt 
and Wnt signaling pathways were analyzed comparatively. In addition, oxidative 
stress parameters (total antioxidant capacity, lipid peroxidase, protein 
carbonyl and reactive oxygen species) were measured comparatively in the study 
groups. The results showed that naltrexone reduced hyperphosphorylated tau 
protein levels by regulating GSK-3β, PP2A, Akt and Wnt signaling. Also, exposure 
to naltrexone decreased oxidative stress parameters. Based on these results, 
naltrexone shows promise as a potential therapy for AD, subject to additional 
clinical assessments.

DUSP4 is a member of the DUSP (dual-specificity phosphatase) subfamily that is 
selective to the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and has been 
implicated in a range of biological processes and functions in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). In this study, we utilized the stereotactic delivery of 
adeno-associated virus (AAV)-DUSP4 to overexpress DUSP4 in the dorsal 
hippocampus of 5xFAD and wildtype (WT) mice, then used mass spectrometry 
(MS)-based proteomics along with the label-free quantification to profile the 
proteome and phosphoproteome in the hippocampus. We identified protein 
expression and phosphorylation patterns modulated in 5xFAD mice and examined the 
sex-specific impact of DUSP4 overexpression on the 5xFAD 
proteome/phosphoproteome. In 5xFAD mice, a substantial number of proteins were 
up- or down-regulated in both male and female mice in comparison to age and 
sex-matched WT mice, many of which are involved in AD-related biological 
processes, such as activated immune response or suppressed synaptic activities. 
Many proteins in pathways, such as immune response were found to be suppressed 
in response to DUSP4 overexpression in male 5xFAD mice. In contrast, such a 
shift was absent in female mice. For the phosphoproteome, we detected an array 
of phosphorylation sites regulated in 5xFAD compared to WT and modulated via 
DUSP4 overexpression in each sex. Interestingly, 5xFAD- and DUSP4-associated 
phosphorylation changes occurred in opposite directions. Strikingly, both the 
5xFAD- and DUSP4-associated phosphorylation changes were found to be mostly in 
neurons and play key roles in neuronal processes and synaptic functions. 
Site-centric pathway analysis revealed that both the 5xFAD- and DUSP4-associated 
phosphorylation sites were enriched for a number of kinase sets in females but 
only a limited number of sets of kinases in male mice. Taken together, our 
results suggest that male and female 5xFAD mice responded to DUSP4 
overexpression via shared and sex-specific molecular mechanisms, which might 
underly similar reductions in amyloid pathology in both sexes while learning 
deficits were reduced in only females with DUSP4 overexpression. Finally, we 
validated our findings with the sex-specific AD-associated proteomes in human 
cohorts and further developed DUSP4-centric proteomic network models and 
signaling maps for each sex.

BACKGROUND: Understanding research participants' responses to learning 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk information is important to inform clinical 
implementation of precision diagnostics given rapid advances in disease 
modifying therapies.
OBJECTIVE: We assessed participants' perspectives on the meaning of their 
amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) imaging results for their health, 
self-efficacy to understand their results, psychological impact of learning 
their results, experience receiving their results from the clinical team, and 
interest in genetic testing for AD risk.
METHODS: We surveyed individuals who were being clinically evaluated for AD and 
received PET imaging six weeks after the return of results. We analyzed 
responses to close-ended survey items by PET result using Fisher's exact test 
and qualitatively coded open-ended responses.
RESULTS: A total of 88 participants completed surveys, most of whom had mild 
cognitive impairment due to AD (38.6%), AD (28.4%), or were cognitively 
unimpaired (21.6%). Participants subjectively understood their results (25.3% 
strongly agreed, 41.8% agreed), which could help them plan (16.5% strongly 
agreed, 49.4% agreed). Participants with a negative PET result (n = 25) reported 
feelings of relief (Fisher's exact p < 0.001) and happiness (p < 0.001) more 
frequently than those with a positive result. Most participants felt that they 
were treated respectfully and were comfortable voicing concerns during the 
disclosure process. Genetic testing was anticipated to be useful for medical 
care decisions (48.2%) and to inform family members about AD risk (42.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: Participants had high subjective understanding and self-efficacy 
around their PET results and did not experience negative psychological effects. 
Interest in genetic testing was high.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a particular type of dementia that 
currently lacks a definitive treatment and cure. It is possible to reduce the 
risk of developing AD and mitigate its severity through modifications to one's 
lifestyle, regular diet, and alcohol-drinking habits.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine the daily dietary patterns 
of individuals with AD compared to healthy controls, with a focus on nutritional 
balance and its impact on AD.
METHODS: This study incorporated multiple-factor analysis (MFA) to evaluate 
dietary patterns and employed Random Forest (RF) classifier and Sparse Logistic 
Regression (SLR) for Variable Importance analysis to identify food items 
significantly associated with AD.
RESULTS: MFA revealed trends in the data and a strong correlation (Lg = 0.92, 
RV = 0.65) between the daily consumption of processed food and meat items in AD 
patients. In contrast, no significant relationship was found for any daily 
consumed food categories within the healthy control (HC) group. Food items such 
as meat pie, hamburger, ham, sausages, beef, capsicum, and cabbage were 
identified as important variables associated with AD in RF and SLR analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings from MFA indicated that the diversity or equilibrium 
of daily diet might play a potential role in AD development. RF and SLR 
classifications exhibit among the processed foods, especially deli meats and 
food made with meat items, are associated with AD.

Lysine-based post-translational modification (PTM) such as acylation, 
acetylation, deamination, methylation, SUMOylation, and ubiquitination has 
proven to be a major regulator of gene expression, chromatin structure, protein 
stability, protein-protein interaction, protein degradation, and cellular 
localization. However, besides all the PTMs, ubiquitination stands as the second 
most common PTM after phosphorylation that is involved in the etiology of 
neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) namely, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
Parkinson's disease (PD). NDDs are characterized by the accumulation of 
misfolded protein aggregates in the brain that lead to disease-related gene 
mutation and irregular protein homeostasis. The ubiquitin-proteasome system 
(UPS) is in charge of degrading these misfolded proteins, which involve an 
interplay of E1, E2, E3, and deubiquitinase enzymes. Impaired UPS has been 
commonly observed in NDDs and E3 ligases are the key members of the UPS, thus, 
dysfunction of the same can accelerate the neurodegeneration process. Therefore, 
the aim of this study is firstly, to find E3 ligases that are common in both AD 
and PD through data mining. Secondly, to study the impact of mutation on its 
structure and function. The study deciphered 74 E3 ligases that were common in 
both AD and PD. Later, 10 hub genes were calculated of which protein-protein 
interaction, pathway enrichment, lysine site prediction, domain, and motif 
analysis were performed. The results predicted BRCA1, PML, and TRIM33 as the top 
three putative lysine-modified E3 ligases involved in AD and PD pathogenesis. 
However, based on structural characterization, BRCA1 was taken further to study 
RING domain mutation that inferred K32Y, K32L, K32C, K45V, K45Y, and K45G as 
potential mutants that alter the structural and functional ability of BRCA1 to 
interact with Ube2k, E2-conjugating enzyme. The most probable mutant observed 
after molecular dynamics simulation of 50 ns is K32L. Therefore, our study 
concludes BRCA1, a potential E3 ligase common in AD and PD, and RING domain 
mutation at sites K32 and K45 possibly disturbs its interaction with its E2, 
Ube2k. Graphical representation of all the steps involved to study mutation in 
the RING domain of BRCA1 which is a common E3 ligase observed in Alzheimer's 
disease and Parkinson's disease.

OBJECTIVES: Metformin, as an insulin sensitizer, is a familiar antidiabetic 
drug. Increasing evidence points to metformin's protective effects against 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanism is not well understood. The 
present study evaluated whether inhibiting AMPK and activating mTOR could stop 
metformin from improving memory in rats with streptozotocin (STZ) -induced 
Alzheimer's disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve-week-old Wistar rats, were injected 3 mg/kg STZ 
intracerebroventricularly on days 1 and 3 to develop the animal model. Metformin 
was applied orally at 100 mg/kg (17 days). Forty-five min before the retrieval 
phase, dorsomorphin (DM; AMPK inhibitor, 2 M) and MHY (mTOR activator, 0.1 M) 
were administered. Morris Water Maze (MWM) and shuttle box were utilized to 
measure spatial and passive avoidance memory, respectively. Congo red staining 
was used to identify cortical amyloid deposition.
RESULTS: The findings exhibited a considerable enhancement in spatial learning 
and memory in the metformin treatment group (P≤0.05). Injection of DM and MHY 
alone could not significantly change MWM and passive avoidance. Additionally, 
co-administration of DM and MHY increased escape latency (P≤0.001) and reduced 
the total time spent in the target quadrant (TTS) (P≤0.05) compared to the 
STZ+MET group during retrieval of MWM. Also, co-injection of DM and MHY 
increased step-through latency (STL) and decreased time spent in the dark 
compartment (TDC) compared to the STZ+MET group (P≤0.001).
CONCLUSION: Metformin appears to have a therapeutic impact by activating AMPK 
and inactivating mTOR. As a result, it could be used as an Alzheimer's treatment 
strategy.

BACKGROUND: Suanzaoren Decoction (SZRD), a well-known formula from traditional 
Chinese medicine, has been shown to have reasonable cognitive effects while 
relaxing and alleviating insomnia. Several studies have demonstrated significant 
therapeutic effects of SZRD on diabetes and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, 
the active ingredients and probable processes of SZRD in treating Alzheimer's 
with diabetes are unknown. This study aims to preliminarily elucidate the 
potential mechanisms and potential active ingredients of SZRD in the treatment 
of Alzheimer's with diabetes.
METHODS: The main components and corresponding protein targets of SZRD were 
searched on the TCMSP database. Differential gene expression analysis for 
diabetes and Alzheimer's disease was conducted using the Gene Expression Omnibus 
database, with supplementation from OMIM and genecards databases for 
differentially expressed genes. The drug-compound-target-disease network was 
constructed using Cytoscape 3.8.0. Disease and SZRD targets were imported into 
the STRING database to construct a protein-protein interaction network. Further, 
Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses were 
performed on the intersection of genes. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics 
simulations were conducted on the Hub gene and active compounds. Gene Set 
Enrichment Analysis was performed to further analyze key genes.
RESULTS: Through the Gene Expression Omnibus database, we obtained 1977 diabetes 
related genes and 622 AD related genes. Among drugs, diabetes and AD, 97 genes 
were identified. The drug-compound-target-disease network revealed that 
quercetin, kaempferol, licochalcone a, isorhamnetin, formononetin, and 
naringenin may be the core components exerting effects. PPI network analysis 
identified hub genes such as IL6, TNF, IL1B, CXCL8, IL10, CCL2, ICAM1, STAT3, 
and IL4. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses 
showed that SZRD in the treatment of Alzheimer's with diabetes is mainly 
involved in biological processes such as response to drug, aging, response to 
xenobiotic, and enzyme binding; as well as signaling pathways such as Pathways 
in cancer, Chemical carcinogenesis - receptor activation, and Fluid shear stress 
and atherosclerosis. Molecular docking results showed that licochalcone a, 
isorhamnetin, kaempferol, quercetin, and formononetin have high affinity with 
CXCL8, IL1B, and CCL2. Molecular dynamics simulations also confirmed a strong 
interaction between CXCL8 and licochalcone a, isorhamnetin, and kaempferol. Gene 
Set Enrichment Analysis revealed that CXCL8, IL1B, and CCL2 have significant 
potential in diabetes.
CONCLUSION: This study provides, for the first time, insights into the active 
ingredients and potential molecular mechanisms of SZRD in the treatment of 
Alzheimer's with diabetes, laying a theoretical foundation for future basic 
research.

The gut microbiota (GM) and its metabolites affect the host nervous system and 
are involved in the pathogeneses of various neurological diseases. However, the 
specific GM alterations under pathogenetic pressure and their contributions to 
the "microbiota - metabolite - brain axis" in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain 
unclear. Here, we investigated the GM and the fecal, serum, cortical metabolomes 
in APP/PS1 and wild-type (WT) mice, revealing distinct hub bacteria in AD mice 
within scale-free GM networks shared by both groups. Moreover, we identified 
diverse peripheral - central metabolic landscapes between AD and WT mice that 
featured bile acids (e.g. deoxycholic and isodeoxycholic acid) and unsaturated 
fatty acids (e.g. 11Z-eicosenoic and palmitoleic acid). Machine-learning models 
revealed the relationships between the differential/hub bacteria and these 
metabolic signatures from the periphery to the brain. Notably, AD-enriched 
Dubosiella affected AD occurrence via cortical palmitoleic acid and vice versa. 
Considering the transgenic background of the AD mice, we propose that Dubosiella 
enrichment impedes AD progression via the synthesis of palmitoleic acid, which 
has protective properties against inflammation and metabolic disorders. We 
identified another association involving fecal deoxycholic acid-mediated 
interactions between the AD hub bacteria Erysipelatoclostridium and AD 
occurrence, which was corroborated by the correlation between deoxycholate 
levels and cognitive scores in humans. Overall, this study elucidated the GM 
network alterations, contributions of the GM to peripheral - central metabolic 
landscapes, and mediatory roles of metabolites between the GM and AD occurrence, 
thus revealing the critical roles of bacteria in AD pathogenesis and gut - brain 
communications under pathogenetic pressure.

BACKGROUND: Sexually active older adults are often more susceptible to HIV and 
other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) due to various health conditions 
(especially a weakened immune system) and low use of condoms. We aimed to assess 
the global, regional, and national burdens and trends of HIV and other STIs in 
older adults from 1990 to 2019.
METHODS: We retrieved data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and 
Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 on the incidence and disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) of HIV and other STIs (syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhoea, 
trichomoniasis, and genital herpes) for older adults aged 60-89 years in 204 
countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. Estimated annual percentage changes 
in the age-standardised incidence and DALY rates of HIV and other STIs, by age, 
sex, and Socio-demographic Index (SDI), were calculated to quantify the temporal 
trends. Spearman correlation analysis was used to examine the relationship 
between age-standardised rates and SDI.
FINDINGS: In 2019, among older adults globally, there were an estimated 77 327 
(95% uncertainty interval 59 443 to 97 648) new cases of HIV (age-standardised 
incidence rate 7·6 [5·9 to 9·6] per 100 000 population) and 26 414 267 
(19 777 666 to 34 860 678) new cases of other STIs (2607·1 [1952·1 to 3440·8] 
per 100 000). The age-standardised incidence rate decreased by an average of 
2·02% per year (95% CI -2·38 to -1·66) for HIV and remained stable for other 
STIs (-0·02% [-0·06 to 0·01]) from 1990 to 2019. The number of DALYs globally in 
2019 was 1 905 099 (95% UI 1 670 056 to 2 242 807) for HIV and 132 033 (95% UI 
83 512 to 225 630) for the other STIs. The age-standardised DALY rate remained 
stable from 1990 to 2019, with an average change of 0·97% (95% CI -0·54 to 2·50) 
per year globally for HIV but decreased by an annual average of 1·55% (95% CI 
-1·66 to -1·43) for other STIs. Despite the global decrease in the 
age-standardised incidence rate of HIV in older people from 1990 to 2019, many 
regions showed increases, with the largest increases seen in eastern Europe 
(average annual change 17·84% [14·16 to 21·63], central Asia (14·26% [11·35 to 
17·25]), and high-income Asia Pacific (7·52% [6·54 to 8·51]). Regionally, the 
age-standardised incidence and DALY rates of HIV and other STIs decreased with 
increases in the SDI.
INTERPRETATION: Although the incidence and DALY rates of HIV and STIs either 
declined or remained stable from 1990 to 2019, there were regional and 
demographic disparities. Health-care providers should be aware of the effects of 
ageing societies and other societal factors on the risk of HIV and other STIs in 
older adults, and develop age-appropriate interventions. The disparities in the 
allocation of health-care resources for older adults among regions of different 
SDIs should be addressed.

Analysis of Effect of Music and Art Combined with Kinect Game Therapy in 
Improving the Cognitive Function and Alleviating Negative Emotions of 
Alzheimer's Disease Patients in a Residential Aged Care Facilities.

Li C, Li P.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major disease that affects 
neurological, cognitive, and memory functions in older adults, and care for AD 
patients needs to be more specialized and targeted.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effect of music and art combined with Kinect game 
therapy as a special care on improving cognitive function and alleviating 
negative emotions in AD patients in a nursing facility.
METHODS: One hundred AD patients admitted to a residential aged care facility in 
Changsha, Hunan Province, China, from December 2020 to December 2022, were 
selected as the study subjects. They were divided into the observation group 
(OG; n=50) for special care of music art combined with Kinect game therapy and 
the control group (CG; n=50) for conventional care. The activities of daily 
living scale (ADL) and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) were used to assess 
the neurological and cognitive functional changes in the two groups before and 
after the nursing intervention. The Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and 
self-rating scale of sleep (SRSS) were used to assess the quality of sleep in 
both groups, and the GQOL-74 scale was used to evaluate the quality of life 
before and after the intervention. The negative emotions were tested by the 
self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale (SDS). Finally, 
patient satisfaction with the care was investigated.
RESULTS: After the nursing intervention, scores of ADL, PSQI, SRSS, SAS and SDS 
of the OG were lower compared with the CG, while MMSE and GQOL-74 scores were 
higher (P < .05). The results of the nursing satisfaction survey were also 
higher in the OG than in the CG (P < .05).
CONCLUSION: The combined music and art therapy with Kinect game therapy in 
elderly institutions can effectively enhance AD patients' neurological and 
cognitive functions, improve their sleep and quality of life, and alleviate 
negative emotions.

Multiple studies have analyzed the possible correlations between diabetes and 
Alzheimer's disease. Less is known about the context of cognitive deterioration 
among patients with atypical Parkinsonian syndromes and glucose metabolism 
impairment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the 
impaired glucose metabolism and cognitive decline among patients with 
progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS). The study 
included 22 patients with PSP and CBS with disease durations varying from 3 to 6 
years. The levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), fasting blood glucose, fasting 
C-peptide and the presence of microalbuminuria were evaluated, and oral glucose 
tolerance tests (OGTT) were performed. Based on the OGTT results, the glycemic 
variability, mean glycemia, glycemia standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of 
variation (%CV) were calculated. All patients underwent a three-Tesla brain 
magnetic resonance (MRI) examination and neuropsychological cognitive assessment 
with the use of standardized scales: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB). A 
statistical analysis revealed that poor control of glycemia with high glycemic 
variability and increased atrophy of the medial temporal lobe among patients 
with PSP and CBS correlated with worse cognitive performance independent of age 
or sex, even among patients who did not fulfill the criteria for diabetes. The 
study results indicate the importance of glucose metabolism control and optimal 
treatment in the context of cognition maintenance among patients with PSP and 
CBS. Due to the relatively small number of analyzed patients, the issue requires 
further assessment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study 
discussing the role of glycemic variability in atypical Parkinsonian syndromes.

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is dysregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
In this study, we have explored the hypothesis that an -age--related imbalance 
in brain RAS is a trigger for RAS dysregulation in AD. We characterized RAS gene 
expression in the frontal cortex from (i) a cohort of normal aging (n = 99, age 
range = 19-96 years) and (ii) a case-control cohort (n = 209) including AD (n = 
66), mixed dementia (VaD + AD; n = 50), pure vascular dementia (VaD; n = 42), 
and age-matched controls (n = 51). The AD, mixed dementia, and age-matched 
controls were further stratified by Braak tangle stage (BS): BS0-II (n = 48), 
BSIII-IV (n = 44), and BSV-VI (n = 85). Gene expression was calculated by 
quantitative PCR (qPCR) for ACE1, AGTR1, AGTR2, ACE2, LNPEP, and MAS1 using the 
2-∆∆Cq method, after adjustment for reference genes (RPL13 and UBE2D2) and 
cell-specific calibrator genes (NEUN, GFAP, PECAM). ACE1 and AGTR1, markers of 
classical RAS signaling, and AGTR2 gene expression were elevated in normal aging 
and gene expression in markers of protective downstream regulatory RAS 
signaling, including ACE2, MAS1, and LNPEP, were unchanged. In AD and mixed 
dementia, AGTR1 and AGTR2 gene expression were elevated in BSIII-IV and BSV-VI, 
respectively. MAS1 gene expression was reduced at BSV-VI and was inversely 
related to parenchymal Aβ and tau load. LNPEP gene expression was specifically 
elevated in VaD. These data provide novel insights into RAS signaling in normal 
aging and dementia.

BACKGROUND: Age is known to be the biggest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), and Mexican Americans (MAs), who are one of the fastest-aging populations 
in the United States, are at a uniquely elevated risk. Mitochondrial stress and 
dysfunction are key players in the progression of AD and are also known to be 
impacted by lifestyle and environmental exposures/stressors.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify population-specific differences in 
indicators of mitochondrial stress and dysfunction associated with AD risk that 
are detectable in the blood.
METHODS: Examining blood from both non-Hispanic white (NHW) and MA participants 
(N = 527, MA n = 284, NHW n = 243), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA 
(nDNA) copy numbers were assessed through quantitative PCR. Data was stratified 
by population and sample type, and multiple linear regression analyses were 
performed to identify factors that may influence this phenotype of mitochondrial 
dysfunction.
RESULTS: In the MA cohort, there was a significant relationship between cellular 
mtDNA:nDNA ratio and body mass index, CDR sum of boxes score, the APOEɛ2/ɛ3 
genotype, and education. Further, there was a significant relationship between 
cell-free mtDNA copy number and both education and CDR sum score. In the NHW 
cohort, there was a significant relationship between cellular mtDNA:nDNA ratio 
and both age and CDR sum score. Age was associated with cell-free mtDNA in the 
NHW cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: This evidence supports the existence of population-based 
differences in the factors that are predictive of this blood-based phenotype of 
mitochondrial dysfunction, which may be indicative of cognitive decline and AD 
risk.

BACKGROUND: Constipation is a common symptom in dementia, and the cause is 
controversial. Rare clinical studies focused on plasma orexin-A levels and 
constipation in dementia.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the associations between orexin-A and constipation in 
patients with cognitive impairment.
METHODS: A total of 21 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 142 with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 57 with Lewy body dementia (LBD) were conducted. 
Besides informant-based history, neurological examinations or neuropsychological 
assessments, plasma levels of orexin-A, and constipation were assessed. The 
associations between orexin-A and constipation were evaluated by logistic 
regression models.
RESULTS: There were 47/220 (21.36%) cognitive impairment patients having 
constipation, and the proportion of constipation in LBD (61.40%) was 
significantly higher than AD (5.63%) and MCI (19.05%). No significant age or sex 
differences in the prevalence of constipation were found in the MCI, AD, and LBD 
groups. We found the cognitive impairment patients with constipation had lower 
levels of plasma orexin-A [1.00 (0.86, 1.28) versus 1.29 (1.01, 1.50) ng/ml, 
p < 0.001] than those without. And the plasma levels of orexin-A were 
significantly associated with the occurrence of constipation after adjusting for 
all variables in all patients with cognitive impairment (OR = 0.151, 95% CI: 
0.042-0.537, p = 0.003). And the same finding was more prominent in the LBD 
group (p = 0.048).
CONCLUSIONS: The decrease of plasma level of orexin-A is closely associated with 
the occurrence of constipation. Orexin-A has an intestinal protective effect and 
is involved in the gastrointestinal symptoms of patients with cognitive 
impairment.

The clinical observation and assessment of extra-ocular movements is common 
practice in assessing neurodegenerative disorders but remains 
observer-dependent. In the present study, we propose an algorithm that can 
automatically identify saccades, fixation, smooth pursuit, and blinks using a 
non-invasive eye tracker. Subsequently, response-to-stimuli-derived 
interpretable features were elicited that objectively and quantitatively assess 
patient behaviors. The cohort analysis encompasses persons with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), 
Parkinson's disease mimics (PDM), and controls (CTRL). Overall, results 
suggested that the AD/MCI and PD groups had significantly different saccade and 
pursuit characteristics compared to CTRL when the target moved faster or covered 
a larger visual angle during smooth pursuit. These two groups also displayed 
more omitted antisaccades and longer average antisaccade latency than CTRL. When 
reading a text passage silently, people with AD/MCI had more fixations. During 
visual exploration, people with PD demonstrated a more variable saccade duration 
than other groups. In the prosaccade task, the PD group showed a significantly 
smaller average hypometria gain and accuracy, with the most statistical 
significance and highest AUC scores of features studied. The minimum saccade 
gain was a PD-specific feature different from CTRL and PDM. These features, as 
oculographic biomarkers, can be potentially leveraged in distinguishing 
different types of NDs, yielding more objective and precise protocols to 
diagnose and monitor disease progression.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-associated neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by progressive neuronal loss and pathological accumulation of the 
misfolded proteins amyloid-β and tau1,2. Neuroinflammation mediated by microglia 
and brain-resident macrophages plays a crucial role in AD pathogenesis1-5, 
though the mechanisms by which age, genes, and other risk factors interact 
remain largely unknown. Somatic mutations accumulate with age and lead to clonal 
expansion of many cell types, contributing to cancer and many non-cancer 
diseases6,7. Here we studied somatic mutation in normal aged and AD brains by 
three orthogonal methods and in three independent AD cohorts. Analysis of bulk 
RNA sequencing data from 866 samples from different brain regions revealed 
significantly higher (~two-fold) overall burdens of somatic single-nucleotide 
variants (sSNVs) in AD brains compared to age-matched controls. 
Molecular-barcoded deep (>1000X) gene panel sequencing of 311 prefrontal cortex 
samples showed enrichment of sSNVs and somatic insertions and deletions 
(sIndels) in cancer driver genes in AD brain compared to control, with 
recurrent, and often multiple, mutations in genes implicated in clonal 
hematopoiesis (CH)8,9. Pathogenic sSNVs were enriched in CSF1R+ microglia of AD 
brains, and the high proportion of microglia (up to 40%) carrying some sSNVs in 
cancer driver genes suggests mutation-driven microglial clonal expansion (MiCE). 
Analysis of single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) from temporal neocortex of 
62 additional AD cases and controls exhibited nominally increased mosaic 
chromosomal alterations (mCAs) associated with CH10,11. Microglia carrying mCA 
showed upregulated pro-inflammatory genes, resembling the transcriptomic 
features of disease-associated microglia (DAM) in AD. Our results suggest that 
somatic driver mutations in microglia are common with normal aging but further 
enriched in AD brain, driving MiCE with inflammatory and DAM signatures. Our 
findings provide the first insights into microglial clonal dynamics in AD and 
identify potential new approaches to AD diagnosis and therapy.

BACKGROUND: The utility of neuropsychological measurements as forerunners of 
Alzheimer's Disease Dementia (AD) in individuals with normal cognition or mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) is undeniable.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the differential prognostic value of cognitive performance 
in older men versus women.
DESIGN: Longitudinal analysis of data acquired from the National Alzheimer's 
Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set.
SETTINGS: Data on older adults (≥60 years) were derived from 43 National 
Institute on Aging - funded Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers.
PARTICIPANTS: 10,073 cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults followed for 
5.5±3.8 years and 3,925 participants with amnestic MCI monitored for 3.5±2.8 
years.
MEASUREMENTS: The domains of episodic memory, verbal fluency, naming, attention, 
processing speed and executive function were assessed. Cox proportional hazards 
models examined associations between individual cognitive domains and AD 
incidence separately for each participant set. CU and MCI. These predictive 
models featured individual neuropsychological measures, sex, neuropsychological 
measure by sex interactions, as well as a number of crucial covariates.
RESULTS: Episodic memory and verbal fluency were differentially related to 
future AD among CU individuals, explaining a larger proportion of risk variance 
in women compared to men. On the other hand, naming, attention and executive 
function were differentially related to future AD among participants with MCI, 
accounting for a greater fraction of risk variance in men than women.
CONCLUSION: Cognitive performance is differentially related to risk of 
progressing to AD in men versus women without dementia.

BACKGROUND: Disparities in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are well-documented among 
different racial/ethnic groups and between sex/genders. Neuropsychological 
assessment provides important information about cognitive changes and can offer 
valuable insights into disparities. However, neuropsychological measures must be 
comparable across racial/ethnic and sex/gender groups to accurately interpret 
disparities.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate measurement invariance (equivalence) of the Preclinical 
Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC) and the Cognitive Function Index across 
racial/ethnic, sex/gender, and β-amyloid (Aβ) status groups.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional analysis of screening data from 
the Anti-Amyloid in Asymptomatic AD (A4) Study. The study enrolled participants 
aged 65-85 from sites across the United States, Canada, Australia, and Japan.
MEASUREMENTS: Participants completed the PACC and the Cognitive Function Index. 
Participants classified as cognitively normal also underwent a Positron Emission 
Tomography (PET) scan to determine Aβ status.
RESULTS: Participants self-identified as non-Hispanic White (n=5241), 
non-Hispanic Black (n=267), Asian (n=228), or Hispanic White (n=225) as well as 
male (n=2885) or female (n=3076). Among those who underwent a PET scan, 3115 
were classified as Aβ- and 1309 were classified as Aβ+. We found support for a 
one-factor model for both the PACC and Cognitive Function Index across the full 
sample and in samples stratified by race/ethnicity, sex/gender, and Aβ status. 
The one-factor model of the PACC and Cognitive Function Index demonstrated 
scalar measurement invariance across racial/ethnic, sex/gender, and Aβ status 
groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that performance on the PACC and Cognitive 
Function Index can be compared across the racial/ethnic, sex/gender, and Aβ

Recently, large-scale scRNA-seq datasets have been generated to understand the 
complex and poorly understood signaling mechanisms within microenvironment of 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD), which are critical for identifying novel therapeutic 
targets and precision medicine. Though a set of targets have been identified, 
however, it remains a challenging to infer the core intra- and inter-multi-cell 
signaling communication networks using the scRNA-seq data, considering the 
complex and highly interactive background signaling network. Herein, we 
introduced a novel graph transformer model, PathFinder, to infer multi-cell 
intra- and inter-cellular signaling pathways and signaling communications among 
multi-cell types. Compared with existing models, the novel and unique design of 
PathFinder is based on the divide-and-conquer strategy, which divides the 
complex signaling networks into signaling paths, and then score and rank them 
using a novel graph transformer architecture to infer the intra- and inter-cell 
signaling communications. We evaluated PathFinder using scRNA-seq data of 
APOE4-genotype specific AD mice models and identified novel APOE4 altered intra- 
and inter-cell interaction networks among neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. 
PathFinder is a general signaling network inference model and can be applied to 
other omics data-driven signaling network inference.

BACKGROUND: Core lexicon (CL) analysis is a time efficient and possibly reliable 
measure that captures discourse production abilities. For people with aphasia, 
CL scores have demonstrated correlations with aphasia severity, as well as other 
discourse and linguistic measures. It was also found to be clinician-friendly 
and clinically sensitive enough to capture longitudinal changes in aphasia. To 
our knowledge, CL has never been investigated in individuals with neurologically 
progressive disease.
AIMS: As a preliminary investigation, we sought to investigate (1) whether CL 
scores correlate with dementia severity, (2) whether CL scores correlate with 
measures of discourse quality, and (3) whether CL scores correlate with other 
measures of lexical/semantic access.
METHODS & PROCEDURES: Twelve participants with a cognitive impairment associated 
with dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) completed several measures of 
language and cognitive ability, as well as provide a language sample from the 
wordless picture book, Picnic.
RESULTS & CONCLUSION: Results are informative, as they provide insight into 
characteristics of CL and provide support for potential use of CL in individuals 
with neurologically progressive disease. The results indicated that CL scores do 
correlate with dementia severity and several measures of language ability, 
indicating they may provide a useful measure of language abilities in DAT, but 
more research is needed.
WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: What is already known on the subject Core lexicon (CL) 
analysis is an assessment measure of discourse ability, most closely related to 
informativeness or productivity, used in aphasiology that is easier to use and 
less time consuming than previous measures of informativeness, such as correct 
information units or type-token ratio (TTR). For people with aphasia, CL 
analysis correlates with aphasia severity, measures of informativeness, as well 
as other measures of discourse quality. It has also been shown to be faster and 
more reliable between scorers than other informativeness measures. What this 
study adds Core lexicon analysis is a new simple and online method for assessing 
the informativeness of a discourse sample without the need to record or 
transcribe the language sample. CL is receiving a lot of attention in aphasia, 
correlating with everything from aphasia severity to measures of productivity 
and lexical access, as well as measures of informativeness. Unfortunately, no 
one has investigated CL analysis in dementia. The study demonstrates the first 
evidence that CL analysis may be a useful measure for determining dementia 
severity and language quality in people with dementia. What are the clinical 
implications of this work? Core lexicon analysis may provide clinicians and 
researchers with an easy method for assessing the discourse of people with a 
cognitive impairment associated with dementia of the Alzheimer's type. This will 
improve initial assessment, as well as improve ongoing language assessment that 
may provide clues into their functional ability to communicate effectively.

Dysfunction of the neurovascular unit stands as a significant pathological 
hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. 
Nevertheless, detecting vascular changes in the brain within bulk tissues has 
proven challenging, limiting our ability to characterize proteomic alterations 
from less abundant cell types. To address this challenge, we conducted 
quantitative proteomic analyses on both bulk brain tissues and 
cerebrovascular-enriched fractions from the same individuals, encompassing 
cognitively unimpaired control, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and AD 
cases. Protein co-expression network analysis identified modules unique to the 
cerebrovascular fractions, specifically enriched with pericytes, endothelial 
cells, and smooth muscle cells. Many of these modules also exhibited significant 
correlations with amyloid plaques, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and/or tau 
pathology in the brain. Notably, the protein products within AD genetic risk 
loci were found concentrated within modules unique to the vascular fractions, 
consistent with a role of cerebrovascular deficits in the etiology of AD. To 
prioritize peripheral AD biomarkers associated with vascular dysfunction, we 
assessed the overlap between differentially abundant proteins in AD 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma with a vascular-enriched network modules in 
the brain. This analysis highlighted matrisome proteins, SMOC1 and SMOC2, as 
being increased in CSF, plasma, and brain. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed 
SMOC1 deposition in both parenchymal plaques and CAA in the AD brain, whereas 
SMOC2 was predominantly localized to CAA. Collectively, these findings 
significantly enhance our understanding of the involvement of cerebrovascular 
abnormalities in AD, shedding light on potential biomarkers and molecular 
pathways associated with CAA and vascular dysfunction in neurodegenerative 
diseases.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
that can cause dementia. We aim to screen out the hub genes involved in AD based 
on microarray datasets.
METHODS: Gene expression profiles GSE5281 and GSE28146 were retrieved from Gene 
Expression Omnibus database to acquire differentially expressed genes (DEGs). 
Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment were conducted using DAVID online tool. The 
STRING database and Cytoscape tools were employed to analyze protein-protein 
interactions and identify hub genes. The predictive value of hub genes was 
assessed by principal component analysis and receiver operating characteristic 
curves. AD mice model was constructed, and histology was then observed by 
hematoxylin-eosin staining. Gene expression levels were finally determined by 
real-time quantitative PCR.
RESULTS: We obtained 197 overlapping DEGs from GSE5281 and GSE28146 datasets. 
After constructing protein-protein interaction network, three highly 
interconnected clusters were identified and 6 hub genes (RBL1, BUB1, HDAC7, 
KAT5, SIRT2, and ITGB1) were selected. The hub genes could be used as basis to 
predict AD. Histological abnormalities of brain were observed, suggesting 
successful AD model was constructed. Compared with the control group, the mRNA 
expression levels of RBL1, BUB1, HDAC7, KAT5 and SIRT2 were significantly 
increased, while the mRNA expression level of ITGB1 was significantly decreased 
in AD groups.
CONCLUSION: RBL1, BUB1, HDAC7, KAT5, SIRT2 and ITGB1 are promising gene 
signatures for diagnosis and therapy of AD.

BACKGROUND: Chronic disruption of the circadian timing system, often reflected 
as a loss of restful sleep, also includes myriad other pathophysiological 
effects.
OBJECTIVE: The current study examined how chronic circadian disruption (CD) 
could contribute to pathology and rate of progression in the AβPP/PS1 mouse 
model of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: A chronic CD was imposed until animals reached 6 or 12 months of age in 
AβPP/PS1 and C57BL/6J control mice. Home cage activity was monitored for a 
period of 3-4 weeks prior to the endpoint along with a single timepoint measure 
of glucose sensitivity. To assess long term effects of CD on the AD phenotype, 
animals were re-entrained to a no disruption (ND) schedule just prior to the 
endpoint, after which a Morris water maze (MWM) was used to assess spatial 
learning and memory.
RESULTS: Dampening of nighttime activity levels occurred in disrupted animals, 
and female animals demonstrated a greater adaptability to CD. Diminished 
arginine vasopressin (AVP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) levels in the 
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of 12-month male AβPP/PS1 exposed to the CD 
paradigm were observed, potentially accounting for the diminished re-entrainment 
response. Similarly, CD worsened performance in the MWM in 12-month male 
AβPP/PS1 animals, whereas no effect was seen in females.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings show that exposure to chronic CD 
impairs circadian behavioral patterns and cognitive phenotypes of AβPP/PS1 mouse 
model in a sex-dependent manner.

Rationale: Promotion of mitophagy is considered a promising strategy for the 
treatment of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The 
development of mitophagy-specific inducers with low toxicity and defined 
molecular mechanisms is essential for the clinical application of 
mitophagy-based therapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential 
of a novel small-molecule mitophagy inducer, ALT001, as a treatment for AD. 
Methods: ALT001 was developed through chemical optimization of an isoquinolium 
scaffold, which was identified from a chemical library screening using a 
mitophagy reporter system. In vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to 
evaluate the potential of ALT001 as a mitophagy-targeting therapeutic agent and 
to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying ALT001-induced mitophagy. The 
therapeutic effect of ALT001 was assessed in SH-SY5Y cells expressing mutant APP 
and mouse models of AD (5×FAD and PS2APP) by analyzing mitochondrial dysfunction 
and cognitive defects. Results: ALT001 specifically induces mitophagy both in 
vitro and in vivo but is nontoxic to mitochondria. Interestingly, we found that 
ALT001 induces mitophagy through the ULK1-Rab9-dependent alternative mitophagy 
pathway independent of canonical mitophagy pathway regulators such as ATG7 and 
PINK1. Importantly, ALT001 reverses mitochondrial dysfunction in SH-SY5Y cells 
expressing mutant APP in a mitophagy-dependent manner. ALT001 induces 
alternative mitophagy in mice and restores the decreased mitophagy level in a 
5×FAD AD model mouse. In addition, ALT001 reverses mitochondrial dysfunction and 
cognitive defects in the PS2APP and 5×FAD AD mouse models. AAV-mediated 
silencing of Rab9 in the hippocampus further confirmed that ALT001 exerts its 
therapeutic effect through alternative mitophagy. Conclusion: Our results 
highlight the therapeutic potential of ALT001 for AD via alleviation of 
mitochondrial dysfunction and indicate the usefulness of the ULK1-Rab9 
alternative mitophagy pathway as a therapeutic target.

INTRODUCTION: Reversion, or change in cognitive status from impaired to normal, 
is common in aging and dementia studies, but it remains unclear what factors 
predict reversion.
METHODS: We investigated whether reverters, defined as those who revert from a 
Clinical Dementia Rating® (CDR®) scale score of 0.5 to CDR 0) differed on 
cognition and biomarkers from unimpaired participants (always CDR 0) and 
impaired participants (converted to CDR > 0 and had no reversion events). Models 
evaluated relationships between biomarker status, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 
status, and cognition. Additional models described predictors of reversion and 
predictors of eventual progression to CDR > 0.
RESULTS: CDR reversion was associated with younger age, better cognition, and 
negative amyloid biomarker status. Reverters that eventually progressed to 
CDR > 0 had more visits, were older, and were more likely to have an APOE ε4 
allele.
DISCUSSION: CDR reversion occupies a transitional phase in disease progression 
between cognitive normality and overt dementia. Reverters may be ideal 
candidates for secondary prevention Alzheimer's disease (AD) trials.
HIGHLIGHTS: Reverters had more longitudinal cognitive decline than those who 
remained cognitively normal. Predictors of reversion: younger age, better 
cognition, and negative amyloid biomarker status. Reverting from CDR 0.5 to 0 is 
a risk factor for future conversion to CDR > 0. CDR reversion may be a 
transitional phase in Alzheimer's Disease progression. CDR reverters may be 
ideal for Alzheimer's disease secondary prevention trials.

Brain-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) play an active role in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), relaying important physiological information about their host 
tissues. The internal cargo of EVs is protected from degradation, making EVs 
attractive AD biomarkers. However, it is unclear how circulating EVs relate to 
EVs isolated from disease-vulnerable brain regions. We developed a novel method 
for collecting EVs from the hippocampal interstitial fluid (ISF) of live mice. 
EVs (EVISF ) were isolated via ultracentrifugation and characterized by 
nanoparticle tracking analysis, immunogold labelling, and flow cytometry. Mass 
spectrometry and proteomic analyses were performed on EVISF cargo. EVISF were 
40-150 nm in size and expressed CD63, CD9, and CD81. Using a model of cerebral 
amyloidosis (e.g., APPswe, PSEN1dE9 mice), we found protein concentration 
increased but protein diversity decreased with Aβ deposition. Genotype, age, and 
Aβ deposition modulated proteostasis- and immunometabolic-related pathways. 
Changes in the microglial EVISF proteome were sexually dimorphic and associated 
with a differential response of plaque associated microglia. We found that 
female APP/PS1 mice have more amyloid plaques, less plaque associated microglia, 
and a less robust- and diverse- EVISF microglial proteome. Thus, in vivo 
microdialysis is a novel technique for collecting EVISF and offers a unique 
opportunity to explore the role of EVs in AD.

OBJECTIVES: The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on cognitive decline are not 
fully understood. Higher social activity and relationships have been associated 
with decreased risk of dementia. We hypothesised that risk of transition to 
dementia would increase after the start of the first national lockdown.
METHODS: We obtained data from the Brains for Dementia (BDR) cohort, which has 
collected roughly annual data on 3726 older adults with and without dementia 
since 2008. Data continued to be collected during the lockdowns, although by 
telephone and/or video call instead of in person. Individuals diagnosed with 
dementia at study entry were excluded from this study as were individuals with 
only one visit. Cognitive status was classified using the Clinical Dementia 
Rating (CDR) global score. Poisson regression with cubic splines to account for 
differences in age was used to compare the incidence of dementia before and 
after March 1st 2020.
RESULTS: Out of 2242 individuals, 208 individuals developed dementia before and 
50 developed dementia after 01/03/20. The incidence rate ratio of developing 
dementia after 01/03/20 was 0.847 (0.538-1.335) p = 0.570. In our secondary 
analysis we found that the positive association between mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and dementia incidence decreased after 1/3/20 (interaction 
effect p = 0.031).
CONCLUSION: The incidence of dementia as defined using the CDR global score did 
not change significantly after the first lockdown began, but we found evidence 
that lockdown decreased the positive association between MCI and dementia 
incidence. This may reflect that individuals were progressing to dementia more 
rapidly and thus missing the MCI stage or that assessing patients over the phone 
made diagnosing MCI more challenging.

BACKGROUND: To examine cross-sectional differences and longitudinal changes in 
cognitive performance based on the presence of mild behavioral impairment (MBI) 
among older adults who are cognitively healthy or have mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI).
METHODS: Secondary data analysis of participants (n = 17 291) who were 
cognitively healthy (n = 11 771) or diagnosed with MCI (n = 5 520) from the 
National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database. Overall, 24.7% of the sample 
met the criteria for MBI. Cognition was examined through a neuropsychological 
battery that assessed attention, episodic memory, executive function, language, 
visuospatial ability, and processing speed.
RESULTS: Older adults with MBI, regardless of whether they were cognitively 
healthy or diagnosed with MCI, performed significantly worse at baseline on 
tasks for attention, episodic memory, executive function, language, and 
processing speed and exhibited greater longitudinal declines on tasks of 
attention, episodic memory, language, and processing speed. Cognitively healthy 
older adults with MBI performed significantly worse than those who were 
cognitively healthy without MBI on tasks of visuospatial ability at baseline and 
on tasks of processing speed across time. Older adults with MCI and MBI 
performed significantly worse than those with only MCI on executive function at 
baseline and visuospatial ability and processing speed tasks across time.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found evidence that MBI is related to poorer cognitive 
performance cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Additionally, those with MBI 
and MCI performed worse across multiple tasks of cognition both 
cross-sectionally and across time. These results provide support for MBI being 
uniquely associated with different aspects of cognition.

BACKGROUND: The efficiencies of plasma Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers could 
facilitate early AD diagnosis. Unfortunately, limited knowledge exists about 
whether and how they would be used by clinicians.
OBJECTIVE: To identify and compare determinants of plasma AD biomarker use 
reported by primary care providers and dementia specialists.
DESIGN: Semi-structured interviews with clinicians organized using Rogers' 
Diffusion of Innovations theory and analyzed using an iterative coding approach.
PARTICIPANTS: The subjects were internal and family medicine, neurology, and 
geriatrics providers with varying degrees of expertise in dementia diagnosis and 
care.
MAIN MEASURES: Factors influencing a clinician's decision to use or not use 
plasma AD biomarkers in clinical practice.
KEY RESULTS: We interviewed 30 clinicians (16 family or internal medicine 
providers, 8 geriatricians, and 6 neurologists). Fifteen were dementia 
specialists. Hesitance to use plasma AD biomarkers was due to perceived lack of 
effective treatments for AD, limited access to supports, and stigma. Plasma AD 
biomarkers would be more readily adopted by clinicians with dementia expertise.
CONCLUSIONS: Several factors will influence clinical use of plasma AD 
biomarkers. Some of them may inform the design of interventions to promote the 
effective and appropriate clinical translation of these tests.

The choroid plexus (CP) is a vital brain structure essential for cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) production. Moreover, alterations in the CP's structure and function 
are implicated in molecular conditions and neuropathologies including multiple 
sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke. Our goal is to provide the first 
characterization of the association between variation in the CP microstructure 
and macrostructure/volume using advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
methodology, and blood-based biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (Aß42/40 ratio; 
pTau181), neuroinflammation and neuronal injury (GFAP; NfL). We hypothesized 
that plasma biomarkers of brain pathology are associated with disordered CP 
structure. Moreover, since cerebral microstructural changes can precede 
macrostructural changes, we also conjecture that these differences would be 
evident in the CP microstructural integrity. Our cross-sectional study was 
conducted on a cohort of 108 well-characterized individuals, spanning 22-94 
years of age, after excluding participants with cognitive impairments and 
non-exploitable MR imaging data. Established automated segmentation methods were 
used to identify the CP volume/macrostructure using structural MR images, while 
the microstructural integrity of the CP was assessed using our advanced 
quantitative high-resolution MR imaging of longitudinal and transverse 
relaxation times (T1 and T2). After adjusting for relevant covariates, positive 
associations were observed between pTau181, NfL and GFAP and all MRI metrics. 
These associations reached significance (p<0.05) except for CP volume vs. 
pTau181 (p=0.14), CP volume vs. NfL (p=0.35), and T2 vs. NFL (p=0.07). Further, 
negative associations between Aß42/40 and all MRI metrics were observed but 
reached significance only for Aß42/40 vs. T2 (p=0.04). These novel findings 
demonstrate that reduced CP macrostructural and microstructural integrity is 
positively associated with blood-based biomarkers of AD pathology, 
neurodegeneration/neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Degradation of the CP 
structure may co-occur with AD pathology and neuroinflammation ahead of 
clinically detectable cognitive impairment, making the CP a potential structure 
of interest for early disease detection or treatment monitoring.

Update of
    bioRxiv. 2023 Aug 06;:

The proliferation of single-cell RNA-sequencing data has led to the widespread 
use of cellular deconvolution, aiding the extraction of cell-type-specific 
information from extensive bulk data. However, those advances have been mostly 
limited to transcriptomic data. With recent developments in single-cell DNA 
methylation (scDNAm), there are emerging opportunities for deconvolving bulk 
DNAm data, particularly for solid tissues like brain that lack cell-type 
references. Due to technical limitations, current scDNAm sequences represent a 
small proportion of the whole genome for each single cell, and those detected 
regions differ across cells. This makes scDNAm data ultra-high dimensional and 
ultra-sparse. To deal with these challenges, we introduce scMD (single cell 
Methylation Deconvolution), a cellular deconvolution framework to reliably 
estimate cell type fractions from tissue-level DNAm data. To analyze large-scale 
complex scDNAm data, scMD employs a statistical approach to aggregate scDNAm 
data at the cell cluster level, identify cell-type marker DNAm sites, and create 
precise cell-type signature matrixes that surpass state-of-the-art sorted-cell 
or RNA-derived references. Through thorough benchmarking in several datasets, we 
demonstrate scMD's superior performance in estimating cellular fractions from 
bulk DNAm data. With scMD-estimated cellular fractions, we identify cell type 
fractions and cell type-specific differentially methylated cytosines associated 
with Alzheimer's disease.

Objective.to develop an optimization and training pipeline for a classification 
model based on principal component analysis and logistic regression using 
neuroimages from PET with 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG PET) for the 
diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).Approach.as training data, 200 FDG PET 
neuroimages were used, 100 from the group of patients with AD and 100 from the 
group of cognitively normal subjects (CN), downloaded from the repository of the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Regularization methods L1 
and L2 were tested and their respective strength varied by the hyperparameter C. 
Once the best combination of hyperparameters was determined, it was used to 
train the final classification model, which was then applied to test data, 
consisting of 192 FDG PET neuroimages, 100 from subjects with no evidence of AD 
(nAD) and 92 from the AD group, obtained at the Centro de Diagnóstico por Imagem 
(CDI).Main results.the best combination of hyperparameters was L1 regularization 
andC≈ 0.316. The final results on test data were accuracy = 88.54%, recall = 
90.22%, precision = 86.46% and AUC = 94.75%, indicating that there was a good 
generalization to neuroimages outside the training set. Adjusting each principal 
component by its respective weight, an interpretable image was obtained that 
represents the regions of greater or lesser probability for AD given high voxel 
intensities. The resulting image matches what is expected by the pathophysiology 
of AD.Significance.our classification model was trained on publicly available 
and robust data and tested, with good results, on clinical routine data. Our 
study shows that it serves as a powerful and interpretable tool capable of 
assisting in the diagnosis of AD in the possession of FDG PET neuroimages. The 
relationship between classification model output scores and AD progression can 
and should be explored in future studies.

Using APP/PS1 mice that overproduce amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, we investigated 
whether intranasal infection with a neurovirulent clinical strain of herpes 
simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) before Aβ deposition could accelerate or increase 
Alzheimer's disease-like pathology. After HSV-1 infection, APP/PS1 mice 
presented a similar disease as wild type animals based on body weight changes, 
clinical symptoms, and survival rates. The number and volume of Aβ plaques, the 
number of microglia, and the percentages of circulating monocyte subsets were 
similar in APP/PS1 mice infected or not with HSV-1. Thus, intranasal infection 
with HSV-1 does not alter Aβ pathology in this mouse model.

OBJECTIVES: Determine if biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and neural injury may 
play a role in the prediction of delirium risk.
METHODS: In a cohort of older adults who underwent elective surgery, delirium 
case-no delirium control pairs (N = 70, or 35 matched pairs) were matched by 
age, sex and vascular comorbidities. Biomarkers from CSF and plasma samples 
collected prior to surgery, including amyloid beta (Aβ)42 , Aβ40 , total 
(t)-Tau, phosphorylated (p)-Tau181 , neurofilament-light (NfL), and glial 
fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) were measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 
plasma using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) or 
ultrasensitive single molecule array (Simoa) immunoassays.
RESULTS: Plasma GFAP correlated significantly with CSF GFAP and both plasma and 
CSF GFAP values were nearly two-fold higher in delirium cases. The median paired 
difference between delirium case and control without delirium for plasma GFAP 
was not significant (p = 0.074) but higher levels were associated with a greater 
risk for delirium (odds ratio 1.52, 95% confidence interval 0.85, 2.72 per 
standard deviation increase in plasma GFAP concentration) in this small study. 
No matched pair differences or associations with delirium were observed for NfL, 
p-Tau 181, Aβ40 and Aβ42 .
CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings suggest that plasma GFAP, a marker of 
astroglial activation, may be worth further investigation as a predictive risk 
marker for delirium.

Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genetic variants are most notably known for their 
divergent impact on the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. While APOE 
genotype has been consistently shown to modulate lipid metabolism in a variety 
of cellular contexts, the effect of APOE alleles on the lipidome in hepatocytes 
is unknown. In this study, we investigated the contribution of APOE alleles to 
lipidomic profiles of donor-derived primary human hepatocytes from 77 subjects. 
Lipidomic data obtained by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were analyzed 
across ε2/ε3, ε3/ε3, and ε3/ε4 genotypes to reveal how APOE modulates lipid 
relative levels over age and between groups. Hepatic APOE concentration, 
measured by ELISA, was assessed for correlation with lipid abundance in subjects 
grouped as per APOE genotype and sex. APOE genotype-specific differential 
lipidomic signatures associated with age for multiple lipid classes but did not 
differ between sexes. Compared to ε2/ε3, ε3/ε4 hepatocytes had higher abundance 
of acylcarnitines (AC) and acylphosphatidylglycerol (AcylPG) as a class, as well 
as higher medium and long-chain ACs, AcylPG, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), 
bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate (BMP), monoacylglycerol (MG) and diacylglycerol 
(DG) species. The ε3/ε4 hepatocytes also exhibited a higher abundance of medium 
and long-chain ACs compared to the ε3/ε3 hepatocytes. Only in the ε3/ε4 
hepatocytes, APOE concentration was lower and showed a negative correlation with 
BMP levels, specifically in females. APOE genotype dictates a differential 
lipidome in primary human hepatocytes. The lipids involved suggest mitochondrial 
dysfunction with accompanying alterations in neutral lipid storage, reflective 
of a general disturbance of free fatty acid metabolism in human hepatocytes with 
the ε4 allele.

BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence has highlighted retinal impairments in 
neurodegenerative diseases. Dominant mutations in TAR DNA-binding protein 43 
(TDP-43) cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and the accumulation of 
TDP-43 in the cytoplasm is a pathological hallmark of ALS, frontotemporal 
dementia (FTD), and many other neurodegenerative diseases.
OBJECTIVE: While homozygous transgenic mice expressing the disease-causing human 
TDP-43 M337V mutant (TDP-43M337V mice) experience premature death, hemizygous 
TDP-43M337V mice do not suffer sudden death, but they exhibit age-dependent 
motor-coordinative and cognitive deficits. This study aims to leverage the 
hemizygous TDP-43M337V mice as a valuable ALS/FTD disease model for the 
assessment also of retinal changes during the disease progression.
METHODS: We evaluated the retinal function of young TDP-43M337V mice by full 
field electroretinogram (ERG) recordings.
RESULTS: At 3-4 months of age, well before the onset of brain dysfunction at 8 
months, the ERG responses were notably impaired in the retinas of young female 
TDP-43M337V mice in contrast to their male counterparts and age-matched 
non-transgenic mice. Mitochondria have been implicated as critical targets of 
TDP-43. Further investigation revealed that significant changes in the key 
regulators of mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics were only observed in the 
retinas of young female TDP-43M337V mice, while these alterations were not 
present in the brains of either gender.
CONCLUSIONS: Together our findings suggest a sex-specific vulnerability within 
the retina in the early disease stage, and highlight the importance of retinal 
changes and mitochondrial markers as potential early diagnostic indicators for 
ALS, FTD, and other TDP-43 related neurodegenerative conditions.

INTRODUCTION: Existing blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
mainly focus on its pathological features. However, studies on blood-based 
biomarkers associated with other biological processes for a comprehensive 
evaluation of AD status are limited.
METHODS: We developed a blood-based, multiplex biomarker assay for AD that 
measures the levels of 21 proteins involved in multiple biological pathways. We 
evaluated the assay's performance for classifying AD and indicating AD-related 
endophenotypes in three independent cohorts from Chinese or European-descent 
populations.
RESULTS: The 21-protein assay accurately classified AD (area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.9407 to 0.9867) and mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI; AUC = 0.8434 to 0.8945) while also indicating brain amyloid 
pathology. Moreover, the assay simultaneously evaluated the changes of five 
biological processes in individuals and revealed the ethnic-specific 
dysregulations of biological processes upon AD progression.
DISCUSSION: This study demonstrated the utility of a blood-based, multi-pathway 
biomarker assay for early screening and staging of AD, providing insights for 
patient stratification and precision medicine.

BACKGROUND: Amyloid beta (Aβ) deposits and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) 
accumulation have been identified in the retina of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
patients and transgenic AD mice. Previous studies have shown that retinal 
microglia engulf Aβ, but this property decreases in AD patients. Whether retinal 
microglia also take up p-tau and if this event is affected in AD is yet not 
described. In the current study, we use the p-tau-specific thiophene-based 
ligand bTVBT2 to investigate the relationship between disease progression and 
p-tau uptake by microglia in the retina of AD patients and AppNL-F/NL-F knock-in 
mice, an AD mouse model known to demonstrate extracellular Aβ plaques and 
dystrophic neurites in the brain from 6 months of age.
METHODS: Evaluation of bTVBT2 specificity and its presence within microglia was 
assessed by immunofluorescent staining of hippocampal sections and flat-mount 
retina samples from non-demented controls, AD patients, 3-, 9-, and 12-month-old 
AppNL-F/NL-F knock-in mice and 12- and 18-month-old wild type (WT) mice. We used 
ImageJ to analyze the amount of bTVBT2 inside Iba1-positive microglia. 
Co-localization between the ligand and p-tau variant Ser396/Ser404 (PHF-1), Aβ, 
phosphorylated TAR DNA binding protein 43 (pTDP-43), and islet amyloid 
polypeptide (IAPP) in the brain and retina was analyzed using confocal imaging.
RESULTS: Confocal imaging analysis showed that bTVBT2 binds to PHF-1- and 
AT8-positive aggregates inside retinal microglia, and not to Aβ, pTDP-43, or 
IAPP. The density of bTVBT2-positive microglia was higher in cases with a high 
Aβ load compared to those with a low Aβ load. This density correlated with the 
neurofibrillary tangle load in the brain, but not with retinal levels of high 
molecular weight (aggregated) Aβ40 or Aβ42. Analysis of AppNL-F/NL-F knock-in 
mouse retina further showed that 50% of microglia in 3-month-old AppNL-F/NL-F 
knock-in mice contained bTVBT2. The percentage significantly increased in 9- and 
12-month-old mice.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the microglial capability to uptake p-tau in 
the retina persists and intensifies with AD progression. These results also 
highlight bTVBT2 as a ligand of interest in future monitoring of retinal AD 
pathology.

One critical manifestation of neurological deterioration is the sign of 
cognitive decline. Causes of cognitive decline include but are not limited to: 
aging, cerebrovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, and trauma. Currently, the 
primary tool used to examine cognitive decline is scale. However, scale 
examination has drawbacks such as its clinician subjectivity and inconsistent 
results. This study attempted to use resting-state EEG to construct a cognitive 
assessment model that is capable of providing a more scientific and robust 
evaluation on cognition levels. In this study, 75 healthy subjects, 99 patients 
with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and 78 patients with dementia were 
involved. Their resting-state EEG signals were collected twice, and the 
recording devices varied. By matching these EEG and traditional scale results, 
the proposed cognition assessment model was trained based on Adaptive Boosting 
(AdaBoost) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) methods, mapping subjects' 
cognitive levels to a 0-100 test score with a mean error of 4.82 (<5%). This 
study is the first to establish a continuous evaluation model of cognitive 
decline on a large sample dataset. Its cross-device usability also suggests 
universality and robustness of this EEG model, offering a more reliable and 
affordable way to assess cognitive decline for clinical diagnosis and treatment 
as well. Furthermore, the interpretability of features involved may further 
contribute to the early diagnosis and superior treatment evaluation of 
Alzheimer's disease.

Expansion of the GGGGCC-RNA repeat is a known cause of amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which currently have no cure. 
Recent studies have indicated the activation of Sigma-1 receptor plays an 
important role in providing neuroprotection, especially in ALS and Alzheimer's 
disease. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying Sigma-1R activation and its 
effect on (G4C2)n-RNA-induced cell death remain unclear. In this study, we 
demonstrated that fluvoxamine is a Sigma-1R agonist that can increase chaperone 
activity and stabilize the protein expression of Pom121 in 
(G4C2)31-RNA-expressing NSC34 cells, leading to increased colocalization at the 
nuclear envelope. Interestingly, fluvoxamine treatment increased Pom121 protein 
expression without affecting transcription. In C9orf72-ALS, the nuclear 
translocation of TFEB autophagy factor decreased owing to nucleocytoplasmic 
transport defects. Our results showed that pretreatment of NSC34 cells with 
fluvoxamine promoted the shuttling of TFEB into the nucleus and elevated the 
expression of LC3-II compared to the overexpression of (G4C2)31-RNA alone. 
Additionally, even when used alone, fluvoxamine increases Pom121 expression and 
TFEB translocation. To summarize, fluvoxamine may act as a promising repurposed 
medicine for patients with C9orf72-ALS, as it stabilizes the nucleoporin Pom121 
and promotes the translocation of TFEB in (G4C2)31-RNA-expressing NSC34 cells.

The potential use of insulin supplementation for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) was 
aimed to investigate and explore CQDs as an alternative delivery system. CQDs 
were produced by microwave and characterised. Insulin-loaded Ins-CQDs and 
in-situ Gel-Ins-CQDs were developed. The in vitro release kinetics, penetrations 
of insulin through excised sheep nasal mucosa were determined. Toxicity of CQDs 
were calculated on SH-SY5Y cells. The stability and usability of the prepared 
formulations were assessed. The insulin release from the solution was 70.75% 
after 3 hours, while it was 37.51% for in-situ Gel-Ins-CQDs. IC50 value was 
52 µM. The mean particle diameters of Ins-CQDs and in-situ Gel-Ins-CQDs varied 
between 8.35 ± 0.19 to 8.75 ± 0.03 nm during a 6-month period. Zeta potentials 
ranged from -31.51 ± 1.39 to -24.43 ± 0.26 mV, and PDI values were between 
9.8 ± 0.01 to 5.3 ± 3.2%(SD, n = 3) for Ins-CQDs and in-situ Gel-Ins-CQDs, 
respectively.Our results show that Gel-Ins-CQDs represented a controlled release 
over time and can be used for AD through the nasal route.

BACKGROUND: The FACEmemory® online platform comprises a complex memory test and 
sociodemographic, medical, and family questions. This is the first study of a 
completely self-administered memory test with voice recognition, pre-tested in a 
memory clinic, sensitive to Alzheimer's disease, using information and 
communication technologies, and offered freely worldwide.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the demographic and clinical variables associated with 
the total FACEmemory score, and to identify distinct patterns of memory 
performance on FACEmemory.
METHODS: Data from the first 3,000 subjects who completed the FACEmemory test 
were analyzed. Descriptive analyses were applied to demographic, FACEmemory, and 
medical and family variables; t-test and chi-square analyses were used to 
compare participants with preserved versus impaired performance on FACEmemory 
(cut-off = 32); multiple linear regression was used to identify variables that 
modulate FACEmemory performance; and machine learning techniques were applied to 
identify different memory patterns.
RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 50.57 years and 13.65 years of 
schooling; 64.07% were women, and 82.10% reported memory complaints with 
worries. The group with impaired FACEmemory performance (20.40%) was older, had 
less schooling, and had a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, 
dyslipidemia, and family history of neurodegenerative disease than the group 
with preserved performance. Age, schooling, sex, country, and completion of the 
medical and family history questionnaire were associated with the FACEmemory 
score. Finally, machine learning techniques identified four patterns of 
FACEmemory performance: normal, dysexecutive, storage, and completely impaired.
CONCLUSIONS: FACEmemory is a promising tool for assessing memory in people with 
subjective memory complaints and for raising awareness about cognitive decline 
in the community.

The most common aging-related neurodegenerative disorder is Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), of which the main symptom is memory disturbance. Though the mechanism of 
AD pathogenesis is not fully defined, abnormal aggregation of amyloid beta (Aβ) 
plaques and tau have been considered as key factors and main histological 
hallmarks of the disease. Astrocyte is responsible for the control of cells and 
the environment around brain and spinal cord cells. Astrocytes have been 
implicated with AD. However, the exact function of astrocytes in AD has not been 
established. In this study, we investigated the regulation of astrocytes in the 
AD model using primary cultures. We have demonstrated that oligomerized Aβ is 
toxic to neurons and can induce cell death in primary cultures. In the primary 
cultures containing neurons and astrocytes, amyloid beta uptake was observed in 
both neurons and astrocytes. To verify if the uptake of amyloid beta in 
astrocytes is dependent on neurons, we separated and cultured primary astrocytes 
with no neurons. Amyloid uptake was still observed in this pure astrocyte 
culture, suggesting that the uptake of amyloid beta is a neuron-independent 
function of astrocytes. Astrocyte activation was observed in both pure and mixed 
cultures. Taken together, our data suggest that astrocyte is activated by 
oligomerized Aβ and uptakes it, which is independent of neurons.

The 14-3-3 proteins are a highly conserved adaptor protein family with 
multi-layer functions, abundantly expressed in the brain. The 14-3-3 proteins 
modulate phosphorylation, regulate enzymatic activity and can act as chaperones. 
Most importantly, they play an important role in various neurodegenerative 
disorders due to their vast interaction partners. Particularly, the 14-3-3ζ 
isoform is known to co-localize in aggregation tangles in both Alzheimer's and 
Parkinson's diseases as a result of protein-protein interactions. These abnormal 
clumps consist of amyloid fibrils, insoluble aggregates, mainly formed by the 
amyloid-β, tau and α-synuclein proteins. However, the molecular basis of if and 
how 14-3-3ζ can aggregate into amyloid fibrils is unknown. In this study, we 
describe the formation of amyloid fibrils by 14-3-3ζ using a comprehensive 
approach that combines bioinformatic tools, amyloid-specific dye binding, 
secondary structure analysis and atomic force microscopy. The results presented 
herein characterize the amyloidogenic properties of 14-3-3ζ and imply that the 
well-folded protein undergoes aggregation to β-sheet-rich amyloid fibrils.

Tau pathology accumulates in the perirhinal cortex (PRC) of the medial temporal 
lobe (MTL) during the earliest stages of the Alzheimer's disease (AD), appearing 
decades before clinical diagnosis. Here, we leveraged perceptual discrimination 
tasks that target PRC function to detect subtle cognitive impairment even in 
nominally healthy older adults. Older adults who did not have a clinical 
diagnosis or subjective memory complaints were categorized into "at-risk" (score 
<26; n = 15) and "healthy" (score ≥26; n = 23) groups based on their performance 
on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The task included two conditions known to 
recruit the PRC: faces and complex objects (greebles). A scene condition, known 
to recruit the hippocampus, and a size control condition that does not rely on 
the MTL were also included. Individuals in the at-risk group were less accurate 
than those in the healthy group for discriminating greebles. Performance on 
either the face or size control condition did not predict group status above and 
beyond that of the greeble condition. Visual discrimination tasks that are 
sensitive to PRC function may detect early cognitive decline associated with AD.

Smilax china L. (Chinaroot) is a natural herb that has multiple uses, such as 
being used to make tea and food. Both its roots and leaves have different uses 
due to their unique components. In this study, we analyzed the extract of S. 
china. roots using LC-HRMS and evaluated the neuroprotective effects and 
metabolic regulation of S. china on Caenorhabditis elegans. Chinaroot extract 
prolonged the life span of healthy nematodes, delayed the paralysis time of 
transgenic CL4176, and reduced the level of β-amyloid deposition in transgenic 
CL2006. The comprehensive analysis of metabolomics and qRT-PCR revealed that 
Chinaroot extract exerted neuroprotective effects through the valine, leucine 
and isoleucine degradation and fatty acid degradation pathways. Moreover, we 
first discovered that the expressions of T09B4.8, ech-7, and agxt-1 were linked 
to the neuroprotective effects of Chinaroot. The material exerted 
neuroprotective effects by modulating metabolic abnormalities in AD model C. 
elegans. Our study provides a new foundation for the development of functional 
food properties and functions.

BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a vital role in the progression of 
vascular dementia (VaD). We hypothesized that transfer of exogenous mitochondria 
might be a beneficial strategy for VaD treatment.
OBJECTIVE: The study was aimed to investigate the role of mitochondrial therapy 
in cognitive function of VaD.
METHODS: The activity and integrity of isolated mitochondria were detected using 
MitoTracker and Janus Green B staining assays. After VaD mice were intravenously 
injected with exogenous mitochondria, Morris water maze and passive avoidance 
tests were used to detect cognitive function of VaD mice. Haematoxylin and 
eosin, Nissl, TUNEL, and Golgi staining assays were utilized to measure neuronal 
and synaptic injury in the hippocampus of VaD mice. Detection kits were 
performed to detect mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ), SOD activity and the 
levels of ATP, ROS, and MDA in the brains of VaD mice.
RESULTS: The results showed that isolated mitochondria were intact and active. 
Mitochondrial therapy could ameliorate cognitive performance of VaD mice. 
Additionally, mitochondrial administration could attenuate hippocampal neuronal 
and synaptic injury, improve mitochondrial ΔΨ, ATP level and SOD activity, and 
reduce ROS and MDA levels in the brains of VaD mice.
CONCLUSIONS: The study reports profitable effect of mitochondrial therapy 
against cognitive impairment of VaD, making mitochondrial treatment become a 
promising therapeutic strategy for VaD.

Alzheimer Disease or Other Dementias in Adult Day Services Centers, 2020.

Singh P, Lendon JP, Sengupta M.

Objectives-Alzheimer disease or other dementias are among the most common 
chronic conditions of adult day services center (ADSC) participants. This report 
compares prevalence of these conditions (referred to collectively as dementia) 
among participants in ADSCs that provide specialized care for dementia with 
other ADSCs, by census region, metropolitan statistical area status, chain 
affiliation, and ownership type. Methods-This report uses data from the ADSC 
component of the 2020 National Post-acute and Long-term Care Study. The survey 
collects data on ADSCs every 2 years from all 50 states and the District of 
Columbia. Data were collected from January 2020 through mid-July 2021. The 
results are based on survey responses from about 1,800 eligible ADSCs from a 
census of 5,500 ADSCs and are weighted to be nationally representative. The 
percentage of participants diagnosed with dementia is calculated from responses 
to a question about the number of current participants diagnosed with dementia. 
Geographical and ADSC characteristics include census region, metropolitan 
statistical area, ownership status, and chain affiliation. Results-In ADSCs that 
provide specialized dementia care, 42.2% of participants had dementia, while 
22.7% of participants also had dementia in ADSCs that do not specialize in 
dementia care. The overall prevalence of dementia was similar across regions, 
with a slightly lower percentage in the West. Dementia was more prevalent in 
ADSCs in metropolitan statistical areas, nonchain centers, and nonprofit 
centers. In general, for each of the selected characteristics, the prevalence of 
dementia was higher in specialized centers than in nonspecialized centers.

Homeostatic modulation is pivotal in modern therapeutics. However, the discovery 
of bioactive materials to achieve this functionality is often random and 
unpredictive. Here, we enabled a systemic identification and functional 
classification of chemicals that elicit homeostatic modulation of signaling 
through Cdc42, a classical small GTPase of Ras superfamily. Rationally designed 
for high throughput screening, the capture of homeostatic modulators (HMs) along 
with molecular re-docking uncovered at least five functionally distinct classes 
of small molecules. This enabling led to partial agonists, hormetic agonists, 
bona fide activators and inhibitors, and ligand-enhanced agonists. Novel HMs 
exerted striking functionality in bradykinin-Cdc42 activation of actin 
remodelingand modified Alzheimer's disease-like behavior in mouse model. This 
concurrent computer-aided and experimentally empowered HM profiling highlights a 
model path for predicting HM landscape.
ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY: With concurrent experimental biochemical profiling and in 
silico computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) analysis, this study enabled a 
systemic identification and holistic classification of Cdc42 homeostatic 
modulators (HMs) and demonstrated the power of CADD to predict HM classes that 
can mimic the pharmacological functionality of interests.
INTRODUCTION: Maintainingbody homeostasisis the ultimate keyto health. Thereare 
rich resources of bioactive materials for this functionality from both natural 
and synthetic chemical repertories including partial agonists (PAs) and various 
allosteric modulators. These homeostatic modulators (HMs) play a unique role in 
modern therapeutics for human diseases such as mental disorders and drug 
addiction. Buspirone, for example, acts as a PA for serotonin 5-HT 1A receptor 
but is an antagonist of the dopamine D 2 receptor. Such medical useto treat 
general anxietydisorders (GADs) has become one of the most-commonly prescribed 
medications. However, most HMs in current uses target membrane proteins and are 
often derived from random discoveries. HMs as therapeutics targeting cytoplasmic 
proteins are even more rare despite that they are in paramount needs (e. g. 
targeting Ras superfamily small GTPases).
RATIONALE: Cdc42, a classical member of small GTPases of Ras superfamily, 
regulates PI3K-AKT and Raf-MEK-ERK pathways and has been implicated in various 
neuropsychiatric and mental disorders as well as addictive diseases and cancer. 
We previously reported the high-throughput in-silico screening followed by 
biological characterization of novel small molecule modulators (SMMs) of 
Cdc42-intersectin (ITSN) protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Based on a 
serendipitously discovered SMM ZCL278 with PA profile as a model compound, we 
hypothesized that there are more varieties of such HMs of Cdc42 signaling, and 
the model HMs can be defined by their distinct Cdc42-ITSN binding mechanisms 
using computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) analysis. We further reasoned that 
molecular modeling coupled with experimental profiling can predict HM spectrum 
and thus open the door for the holistic identification and classification of 
multifunctional cytoplasmic target-dependent HMs as therapeutics.
RESULTS: The originally discovered Cdc42 inhibitor ZCL278 displaying PA 
properties prompted the inquiry whether this finding represented a random 
encounter of PAs or whether biologically significant PAs can be widely present. 
The top ranked compounds were initially defined by structural fitness and 
binding scores to Cdc42. Because higher binding scores do not necessarily 
translate to higher functionality, we performed exhaustive experimentations with 
over 2,500 independent Cdc42-GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) assays to 
profile the GTP loading activities on all 44 top ranked compounds derived from 
the SMM library. The N-MAR-GTP fluorophore-based Cdc42-GEF assay platform 
provided the first glimpse of the breadth of HMs. A spectrum of Cdc42 HMs was 
uncovered that can be categorized into five functionally distinct classes: Class 
I-partial competitive agonists, Class II-hormetic agonists, Class III- bona fide 
inhibitors (or inverse agonists), Class IV- bona fide activators or agonists, 
and Class V-ligand-enhanced agonists. Remarkably, model HMs such as ZCL278, 
ZCL279, and ZCL367 elicited striking biological functionality in 
bradykinin-Cdc42 activation of actin remodeling and modified Alzheimer's disease 
(AD)-like behavior in mouse model. Concurrently, we applied Schrödinger-enabled 
analyses to perform CADD predicted classification of Cdc42 HMs. We modified the 
classic molecular docking to instill a preferential binding pocket order (PBPO) 
of Cdc42-ITSN, which was based on the five binding pockets in interface of 
Cdc42-ITSN. We additionally applied a structure-based pharmacophore hypothesis 
generation for the model compounds. Then, using Schrödinger's Phase Shape, 3D 
ligand alignments assigned HMs to Class I, II, III, IV, and V compounds. In this 
HM library compounds, PBPO, matching pharmacophoric featuring, and shape 
alignment, all put ZCL993 in Class II compound category, which was confirmed in 
the Cdc42-GEF assay.
CONCLUSION: HMs can target diseased cells or tissues while minimizing impacts on 
tissues that are unaffected. Using Cdc42 HM model compounds as a steppingstone, 
GTPase activation-based screening of SMM library uncovered five functionally 
distinct Cdc42 HM classes among which novel efficacies towards alleviating 
dysregulated AD-like features in mice were identified. Furthermore, molecular 
re-docking of HM model compounds led to the concept of PBPO. The CADD analysis 
with PBPO revealed similar profile in a color-coded spectrum to these five 
distinct classes of Cdc42 HMs identified by biochemical functionality-based 
screening. The current study enabled a systemic identification and holistic 
classification of Cdc42 HMs and demonstrated the power of CADD to predict an HM 
category that can mimic the pharmacological functionality of interests. With 
artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) on the horizon to mirror 
experimental pharmacological discovery like AlphaFold for protein structure 
prediction, our study highlights a model path to actively capture and profile 
HMs in potentially any PPI landscape.
IDENTIFICATION AND FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF CDC42 HOMEOSTATIC MODULATORS 
HMS: Using Cdc42 HM model compounds as reference, GTPase activation-based 
screening of compound libraries uncovered five functionally distinct Cdc42 HM 
classes. HMs showed novel efficacies towards alleviating dysregulated 
Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like behavioral and molecular deficits. In parallel, 
molecular re-docking of HM model compounds established their preferential 
binding pocket orders (PBPO). PBPO-based profiling (Red reflects the most, 
whereas green reflects the least, preferable binding pocket) revealed trends of 
similar pattern to the five classes from the functionality-based classification.

BACKGROUND: Impaired odor identification is a characteristic of sporadic 
Alzheimer'sdisease(AD), but its presence in autosomal-dominantAD (adAD) remains 
uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate odor identification ability in mutation carriers (MC) 
and non-carriers (NC) of adAD in relation to years to estimated clinical onset 
clinical onset (YECO) of disease.
METHODS: Participants from six families with autosomal-dominant mutations (APP 
Swedish, APP Arctic, and PSEN1 mutations) included 20 MC and 20 NC. The groups 
were comparable in age, gender, education, number of APOE ɛ4 alleles, and YECO, 
but differed in global cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination). The MC group 
included individuals in asymptomatic, symptomatic cognitively unimpaired, mild 
cognitive impairment, and dementia stages of disease, spanning approximately 40 
years of the AD continuum. All NC were asymptomatic. Olfactory function was 
assessed by means of free and cued identification of common odors summarized as 
total identification.
RESULTS: MC performed poorer than NC in free and total identification. Four MC 
and none of the NC were anosmic. Olfactory functions in MC and NC were 
significantly and inversely related to time course (YECO) for both free and 
total identification. The decline in free identification began approximately 10 
years prior to the estimated clinical onset of AD in MC. Odor identification 
proficiency was associated with episodic memory and executive function in MC and 
NC.
CONCLUSIONS: Impaired odor identification is present well before the clinical 
diagnosis of AD in MC and is associated with disease progression. Odor 
identification ability may be a useful early biomarker for adAD.

Age is an important variable to describe the expected brain's anatomy status 
across the normal aging trajectory. The deviation from that normative aging 
trajectory may provide some insights into neurological diseases. In 
neuroimaging, predicted brain age is widely used to analyze different diseases. 
However, using only the brain age gap information (i.e., the difference between 
the chronological age and the estimated age) can be not enough informative for 
disease classification problems. In this paper, we propose to extend the notion 
of global brain age by estimating brain structure ages using structural magnetic 
resonance imaging. To this end, an ensemble of deep learning models is first 
used to estimate a 3D aging map (i.e., voxel-wise age estimation). Then, a 3D 
segmentation mask is used to obtain the final brain structure ages. This 
biomarker can be used in several situations. First, it enables to accurately 
estimate the brain age for the purpose of anomaly detection at the population 
level. In this situation, our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art 
methods. Second, brain structure ages can be used to compute the deviation from 
the normal aging process of each brain structure. This feature can be used in a 
multi-disease classification task for an accurate differential diagnosis at the 
subject level. Finally, the brain structure age deviations of individuals can be 
visualized, providing some insights about brain abnormality and helping 
clinicians in real medical contexts.

BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies 
(DLB) are characterized by diffuse spread of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) throughout 
the brain. Patients with PDD and DLB have a neuropsychological pattern of 
deficits that include executive dysfunction, such as abnormalities in planning, 
timing, working memory, and behavioral flexibility. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) 
plays a major role in normal executive function and often develops α-syn 
aggregates in DLB and PDD.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the long-term behavioral and cognitive consequences of 
α-syn pathology in the cortex and characterize pathological spread of α-syn.
METHODS: We injected human α-syn pre-formed fibrils into the PFC of wild-type 
male mice. We then assessed the behavioral and cognitive effects between 12- and 
21-months post-injection and characterized the spread of pathological α-syn in 
cortical, subcortical, and brainstem regions.
RESULTS: We report that PFC PFFs: 1) induced α-syn aggregation in multiple 
cortical and subcortical regions with sparse aggregation in midbrain and 
brainstem nuclei; 2) did not affect interval timing or spatial learning 
acquisition but did mildly alter behavioral flexibility as measured by intraday 
reversal learning; and 3) increased open field exploration.
CONCLUSIONS: This model of cortical-dominant pathology aids in our understanding 
of how local α-syn aggregation might impact some symptoms in PDD and DLB.

There are epidemiological associations between obesity and type 2 diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease. The role of amyloid beta 42 
(Aβ42) in these diverse chronic diseases is obscure. Here we show that adipose 
tissue releases Aβ42, which is increased from adipose tissue of male mice with 
obesity and is associated with higher plasma Aβ42. Increasing circulating Aβ42 
levels in male mice without obesity has no effect on systemic glucose 
homeostasis but has obesity-like effects on the heart, including reduced cardiac 
glucose clearance and impaired cardiac function. The closely related Aβ40 
isoform does not have these same effects on the heart. Administration of an 
Aβ-neutralising antibody prevents obesity-induced cardiac dysfunction and 
hypertrophy. Furthermore, Aβ-neutralising antibody administration in established 
obesity prevents further deterioration of cardiac function. Multi-contrast 
transcriptomic analyses reveal that Aβ42 impacts pathways of mitochondrial 
metabolism and exposure of cardiomyocytes to Aβ42 inhibits mitochondrial complex 
I. These data reveal a role for systemic Aβ42 in the development of cardiac 
disease in obesity and suggest that therapeutics designed for Alzheimer's 
disease could be effective in combating obesity-induced heart failure.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, there has been a growing interest, supported by 
many experimental and clinical studies, about the benefits of pomegranate in 
preventing various pathologic conditions, including brain neurodegeneration. The 
pomegranate seed oil (PSO) contains high levels of fatty acids that have 
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.
OBJECTIVE: Due to the lack of clinical trials, the aim of the present study was 
to investigate the effects of PSO on cognition of people with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI).
METHODS: Eighty people with the diagnosis of MCI were randomized forty to take 5 
drops of PSO and follow the Mediterranean Diet (MeDi) and forty just followed 
MeDi. All were examined with an extensive neuropsychological assessment before 
and after one year of treatment.
RESULTS: The results showed that the participants who took the PSO had 
statistically significantly better global cognition (p = 0.004), verbal episodic 
memory (p = 0.009), and processing and executive functions (p <  0.001) in 
contrast with the participants who did not take it.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the PSO can be beneficial for people with MCI as it 
is helpful for some important cognitive domains. As PSO is a natural product 
that does not burden the human body, it can be used by people with MCI and be a 
significant and promising part of holistic approaches for the prevention of 
dementia.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered to have a multifactorial 
etiology. The hallmark of AD is progressive neurodegeneration, which is 
characterized by the deepening loss of memory and a high mortality rate in the 
elderly. The neurodegeneration in AD is believed to be exacerbated following the 
intercoupled cascades of extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, uncontrolled 
microglial activation, and neuroinflammation. Current therapies for AD are 
mostly designed to target the symptoms, with limited ability to address the 
mechanistic triggers for the disease. In this study, we report a novel 
nanotechnology based on microglial scavenger receptor (SR)-targeting amphiphilic 
nanoparticles (NPs) for the convergent alleviation of fibril Aβ (fAβ) burden, 
microglial modulation, and neuroprotection.
METHODS: We designed a nanotechnology approach to regulate the SR-mediated 
intracellular fAβ trafficking within microglia. We synthesized SR-targeting 
sugar-based amphiphilic macromolecules (AM) and used them as a bioactive shell 
to fabricate serum-stable AM-NPs via flash nanoprecipitation. Using electron 
microscopy, in vitro approaches, ELISA, and confocal microscopy, we investigated 
the effect of AM-NPs on Aβ fibrilization, fAβ-mediated microglial inflammation, 
and neurotoxicity in BV2 microglia and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell lines.
RESULTS: AM-NPs interrupted Aβ fibrilization, attenuated fAβ microglial 
internalization via targeting the fAβ-specific SRs, arrested the fAβ-mediated 
microglial activation and pro-inflammatory response, and accelerated lysosomal 
degradation of intracellular fAβ. Moreover, AM-NPs counteracted the 
microglial-mediated neurotoxicity after exposure to fAβ.
CONCLUSIONS: The AM-NP nanotechnology presents a multifactorial strategy to 
target pathological Aβ aggregation and arrest the fAβ-mediated pathological 
progression in microglia and neurons.

Estimating Functional Brain Networks by Low-Rank Representation With Local 
Constraint.

Li Z, Zheng W, Liu H, Liu J, Yan C, Wang Z, Hu B, Dong Q.

The functional architecture undergoes alterations during the preclinical phase 
of Alzheimer's disease. Consequently, the primary research focus has shifted 
towards identifying Alzheimer's disease and its early stages by constructing a 
functional connectivity network based on resting-state fMRI data. Recent 
investigations show that as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) progresses, modular tissue 
and connections in the core brain areas of AD patients diminish. Sparse learning 
methods are powerful tools for understanding Functional Brain Networks (FBNs) 
with Regions of Interest (ROIs) and a connectivity matrix measuring functional 
coherence between them. However, these tools often focus exclusively on 
functional connectivity measures, neglecting the brain network's modularity. 
Modularity orchestrates dynamic activities within the FBN to execute intricate 
cognitive tasks. To provide a comprehensive delineation of the FBN, we propose a 
local similarity-constrained low-rank sparse representation (LSLRSR) method that 
encodes modularity information under a manifold-regularized network learning 
framework and further formulate it as a low-rank sparse graph learning problem, 
which can be solved by an efficient optimization algorithm. Specifically, for 
each modularity structure, the Schatten p-norm regularizer reduces the 
reconstruction error and provides a better approximation of the low-rank 
constraint. Furthermore, we adopt a manifold-regularized local similarity prior 
to infer the intricate relationship between subnetwork similarity and 
modularity, guiding the modeling of FBN. Additionally, the proximal average 
method approximates the joint solution's proximal map, and the resulting 
nonconvex optimization problems are solved using the alternating direction 
multiplier method (ADMM). Compared to state-of-the-art methods for constructing 
FBNs, our algorithm generates a more modular FBN. This lays the groundwork for 
further research into alterations in brain network modularity resulting from 
diseases.

Technology can support the delivery of care and improve the lives of people 
living with dementia. However, despite a substantial body of evidence 
demonstrating the benefits and opportunities afforded by technology, gaps remain 
in how technology and technology ethics are addressed in dementia care 
education. Here we discuss disparities in current educational programming and 
highlight the ethical challenges arising from underdeveloped knowledge exchange 
about dementia care technology. We put forward that for technology to be 
ethically deployed and maximized to improve outcomes, it must be embedded into 
dementia education programs and made widely accessible to the caregiver 
community.

BACKGROUND: Comorbidities reduce quality of life for people with dementia and 
caregivers. Some comorbidities share a genetic basis with dementia.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to assess comorbidity in patients with 
different dementia subtypes in order to better understand the pathogenesis of 
dementias.
METHODS: A total of 298 patients with dementia were included. We collected some 
common comorbidities. We analyzed the differences in comorbidities among 
patients with dementia according to clinical diagnosis, age of onset 
(early-onset: < 65 and late-onset: ≥65 years old) and apolipoprotein (APOE) 
genotypes by using the univariate and multivariate approaches.
RESULTS: Among 298 participants, there were 183 Alzheimer's disease (AD), 40 
vascular dementia (VaD), 37 frontotemporal dementia (FTLD), 20 Lewy body 
dementia (LBD), and 18 other types of dementia. Based on age of onset, 156 cases 
had early-onset dementia and 142 cases had late-onset dementia. The most common 
comorbidities observed in all dementia patients were hyperlipidemia (68.1%), 
hypertension (39.9%), insomnia (21.1%), diabetes mellitus (19.5%), and hearing 
impairment (18.1%). The prevalence of hypertension and cerebrovascular disease 
was found to be higher in patients with VaD compared to those with AD 
(p = 0.002, p < 0.001, respectively) and FTLD (p = 0.028, p = 0.004, 
respectively). Additionally, patients with late-onset dementia had a higher 
burden of comorbidities compared to those with early-onset dementia. It was 
observed that APOE ɛ4/ɛ4 carriers were less likely to have insomnia (p = 0.031).
CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidities are prevalent in patients with dementia, with 
hyperlipidemia, hypertension, insomnia, diabetes, and hearing impairment being 
the most commonly observed. Comorbidity differences existed among different

BACKGROUND: Intrinsic capacity (IC) is a concept related to functionality that 
reflects healthy aging. ATPase inhibitory factor 1 (IF1) is a multifaceted 
protein that regulates mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and may 
be involved in IC. The objective of this study is to investigate the association 
between plasma levels of IF1 and IC changes in community-dwelling older adults.
METHODS: Community-dwelling older adults from the Multidomain Alzheimer 
Preventive Trial (MAPT Study) were enrolled in this study. A composite IC score 
was calculated based on 4 IC domains: locomotion, psychological dimension, 
cognition, and vitality (with data available annually over 4 years of 
follow-up). Secondary analyses were conducted on the sensory domain (with data 
available only for 1 year of follow-up). Mixed-model linear regression adjusted 
for confounders was conducted.
RESULTS: A total of 1 090 participants with usable IF1 values were included in 
the study (75.3 ± 4.4 years; 64% females). Compared to the lowest quartile, both 
the low- and high-intermediate IF1 quartiles were found to be cross-sectionally 
associated with greater composite IC scores across 4 domains (βlow-intermediate, 
1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06-2.60 and βhigh-intermediate, 1.78; 95% 
CI 0.49-3.06). In the secondary analyses, the highest quartile was found to be 
associated with a slower decline in composite IC scores across 5 domains over 1 
year (βhigh 1.60; 95% CI 0.06-3.15). The low- and high-intermediate IF1 
quartiles were also found to be cross-sectionally associated with greater 
locomotion (βlow-intermediate, 2.72; 95% CI 0.36-5.08) and vitality scores 
(βhigh-intermediate, 1.59; 95% CI 0.06-3.12), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to demonstrate that levels of circulating 
IF1, a mitochondrial-related biomarker, are associated with IC composite scores 
in both cross-sectional and prospective analyses among community-dwelling older 
adults. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and 
elucidate the potential underlying mechanisms that may explain these 
associations.

RATIONALE: The β-secretase BACE1 initiates amyloid-β (Aβ) generation and 
represents a long-standing prime therapeutic target for the treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, BACE1 inhibitors tested to date in clinical 
trials have yielded no beneficial outcomes. In fact, prior BACE1 inhibitor 
trials targeted at ~ 50-90% Aβ reductions in symptomatic or prodromal AD stages 
have ended in the discontinuation due to futility and/or side effects, including 
cognitive worsening rather than expected improvement at the highest dose.
OBJECTIVES: We tested whether a combination strategy with the selective BACE1 
inhibitor GRL-8234 and the FDA-approved symptomatic drug memantine may provide 
synergistic cognitive benefits within their safe dose range.
METHODS: The drug effects were evaluated in the advanced symptomatic stage of 
5XFAD mice that developed extensive cerebral Aβ deposition.
RESULTS: Chronic combination treatment with 33.4-mg/kg GRL-8234 and 10-mg/kg 
memantine, but not either drug alone, rescued cognitive deficits in 5XFAD mice 
at 12 months of age (the endpoint after 60-day drug treatment), as assessed by 
the contextual fear conditioning, spontaneous alternation Y-maze and nest 
building tasks. Intact baseline performances of wild-type control mice on three 
cognitive paradigms demonstrated that combination treatment did not augment 
potential cognitive side effects of individual drugs. Biochemical and 
immunohistochemical examination showed that combination treatment did not 
synergistically reduce the β-amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor 
protein or Aβ levels in 5XFAD mouse brains.
CONCLUSIONS: A combination strategy with BACE1 inhibitors and memantine may be 
able to increase the effectiveness of individual drugs within their safe dose 
range in AD therapy.

Update of
    ArXiv. 2023 Jan 25;:

Disease heterogeneity has been a critical challenge for precision diagnosis and 
treatment, especially in neurologic and neuropsychiatric diseases. Many diseases 
can display multiple distinct brain phenotypes across individuals, potentially 
reflecting disease subtypes that can be captured using MRI and machine learning 
methods. However, biological interpretability and treatment relevance are 
limited if the derived subtypes are not associated with genetic drivers or 
susceptibility factors. Herein, we describe Gene-SGAN - a multi-view, 
weakly-supervised deep clustering method - which dissects disease heterogeneity 
by jointly considering phenotypic and genetic data, thereby conferring genetic 
correlations to the disease subtypes and associated endophenotypic signatures. 
We first validate the generalizability, interpretability, and robustness of 
Gene-SGAN in semi-synthetic experiments. We then demonstrate its application to 
real multi-site datasets from 28,858 individuals, deriving subtypes of 
Alzheimer's disease and brain endophenotypes associated with hypertension, from 
MRI and single nucleotide polymorphism data. Derived brain phenotypes displayed 
significant differences in neuroanatomical patterns, genetic determinants, 
biological and clinical biomarkers, indicating potentially distinct underlying 
neuropathologic processes, genetic drivers, and susceptibility factors. Overall, 
Gene-SGAN is broadly applicable to disease subtyping and endophenotype 
discovery, and is herein tested on disease-related, genetically-associated 
neuroimaging phenotypes.

BACKGROUND: Obesity rates in the U.S. continue to increase, with nearly 50% of 
the population being either obese or morbidly obese. Obesity, along with female 
sex, are leading risk factors for sporadic Alzheimer's Disease (AD) 
necessitating the need to better understand how these variables impact cellular 
function independent of age or genetic mutations. Animal and clinical studies 
both indicate that autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) dysfunction is among the 
earliest known cellular systems to become perturbed in AD, preceding cognitive 
decline, yet little is known about how obesity and sex affects these cellular 
functions in the hippocampus, a brain region uniquely susceptible to the 
negative effects of obesity. We hypothesized that obesity would negatively 
affect key markers of ALP in the hippocampus, effects would vary based on sex, 
and that caloric restriction would counteract obesity effects.
METHODS: Female and male mice were placed on an obesogenic diet for 10 months, 
at which point half were switched to caloric restriction for three months, 
followed by cognitive testing in the Morris watermaze. Hippocampus was analyzed 
by western blot and qPCR.
RESULTS: Cognitive function in female mice responded differently to caloric 
restriction based on whether they were on a normal or obesogenic diet; male 
cognition was only mildly affected by caloric restriction and not obesity. 
Significant male-specific changes occurred in cellular markers of autophagy, 
including obesity increasing pAkt, Slc38a9, and Atg12, while caloric restriction 
reduced pRPS6 and increased Atg7. In contrast females experienced changes due to 
diet/caloric restriction predominately in lysosomal markers including increased 
TFE3, FLCN, FNIP2, and pAMPK.
CONCLUSIONS: Results support that hippocampal ALP is a target of obesity and 
that sex shapes molecular responses, while providing insight into how dietary 
manipulations affect learning and memory based on sex.

Dementia is a syndrome that can cause a number of progressive illnesses that 
affect memory, thinking, and ability to perform everyday tasks. Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and represents a major public 
health problem. AD is a progressive disease, where in early stages there is mild 
memory loss and in late-stage patient loses the ability to carry on a 
conversation. AD (for which there is no exact cause and cure known so far) is 
the sixth leading cause of deaths in the United States. Every 68 second someone 
develops AD. This study focuses on protein structure modeling of genes 
presenilin 1 and 2 ( PSEN1 and PSEN2 ) and their mutated forms (Asn141Tyr found 
in Chinese family, Gly34Ser identified in a Japanese patient, and Arg62Cys & 
Val214Leu identified in the Korean patients). It also involves wild and mutant 
type comparison, protein interaction studies, docking and phylogenetic history 
based on representative ortholog species and also sheds insight into the 
comparative evolutionary rates of coding sequence across various orthologs. This 
study gives a time and cost-effective analysis of genes ( PSEN1 and PSEN2 ) 
underlying AD and genetic alterations that drive development and causes of 
disease.

A major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of aggregated 
amyloid β peptide (Aβ) in the brain. Here we develop a solubility assay for 
proteins and measure the solubility of Aβ40. In brief, the method utilizes 
96-well filter plates to separate monomeric Aβ from aggregated Aβ, and the small 
species are quantified with the amine reactive dye o-phthalaldehyde (OPA). This 
procedure ensures that solubility is measured for unlabeled species, and makes 
the assay high-throughput and inexpensive. We demonstrate that the filter plates 
successfully separate fibrils from monomer, with negligible monomer adsorption, 
and that OPA can quantify Aβ peptides in a concentration range from 40 nM to 
20 μM. We also show that adding a methionine residue to the N-terminus of Aβ1-40 
decreases the solubility by <3-fold. The method will facilitate further 
solubility studies, and contribute to the understanding of the thermodynamics of 
amyloid fibril formation.

INTRODUCTION: We investigated the association of inflammatory mechanisms with 
markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and rates of cognitive decline in 
the AD spectrum.
METHODS: We studied 296 cases from the Deutsches Zentrum für Neurodegenerative 
Erkrankungen Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Study (DELCODE) 
cohort, and an extension cohort of 276 cases of the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative study. Using Bayesian confirmatory factor analysis, we 
constructed latent factors for synaptic integrity, microglia, cerebrovascular 
endothelial function, cytokine/chemokine, and complement components of the 
inflammatory response using a set of inflammatory markers in cerebrospinal 
fluid.
RESULTS: We found strong evidence for an association of synaptic integrity, 
microglia response, and cerebrovascular endothelial function with a latent 
factor of AD pathology and with rates of cognitive decline. We found evidence 
against an association of complement and cytokine/chemokine factors with AD 
pathology and rates of cognitive decline.
DISCUSSION: Latent factors provided access to directly unobservable components 
of the neuroinflammatory response and their association with AD pathology and 
cognitive decline.

BACKGROUND: Pilot study showed that Alzheimer's disease resemblance atrophy 
index (AD-RAI), a machine learning-derived MRI-based neurodegeneration biomarker 
of AD, achieved excellent diagnostic performance in diagnosing AD with moderate 
to severe dementia.
OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to validate and compare the performance of 
AD-RAI with conventional volumetric hippocampal measures in diagnosing AD with 
mild dementia. The secondary objectives were 1) to investigate the association 
between imaging biomarkers with age and gender among cognitively unimpaired (CU) 
participants; 2) to analyze whether the performance of differentiating AD with 
mild dementia from CU will improve after adjustment for age/gender.
METHODS: AD with mild dementia (n = 218) and CU (n = 1,060) participants from 4 
databases were included. We investigated the area under curve (AUC), 
sensitivity, specificity, and balanced accuracy of AD-RAI, hippocampal volume 
(HV), and hippocampal fraction (HF) in differentiating between AD and CU 
participants. Among amyloid-negative CU participants, we further analyzed 
correlation between the biomarkers with age/gender. We also investigated whether 
adjustment for age/gender will affect performance.
RESULTS: The AUC of AD-RAI (0.93) was significantly higher than that of HV 
(0.89) and HF (0.89). Subgroup analysis among A + AD and A- CU showed that AUC 
of AD-RAI (0.97) was also higher than HV (0.94) and HF (0.93). Diagnostic 
performance of AD-RAI and HF was not affected by age/gender while that of HV 
improved after age adjustment.
CONCLUSIONS: AD-RAI achieves excellent clinical validity and outperforms 
conventional volumetric hippocampal measures in aiding the diagnosis of AD mild 
dementia without the need for age adjustment.

BACKGROUND: The pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves the 
interplay of three different processes: pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis.
OBJECTIVE: To explore role of PANoptosis, a novel pro-inflammatory programmed 
cell death pathway, in AD patients.
METHODS: We performed a consensus clustering analysis to identify distinct 
transcriptional profiles in the samples using the R package 
"ConsensusClusterPlus". The PANoptosis key genes were obtained by crossing the 
WGCNA brown module and differentially expressed PANoptosis genes. We 
accomplished regression analyses using the LASSO-Cox method, combined with 
pathological status and gene expression data. At the same time, we also 
constructed PANscore system. The expression of PANoptosis hub genes were 
validated by qRT-PCR in AD transgenic mice.
RESULTS: Our study utilized tissue expression profile data from AD patients to 
construct three distinct PANoptosis patterns, each with unique molecular and 
clinical characteristics. We have created a risk scoring system called PANscore, 
which can analyze patterns specific for each AD patient. Additionally, we 
observed significantly lower levels of follicular helper T (Tfh) cells in the 
high PANscore and AD patients. Further analysis revealed a significant negative 
correlation of Tfh with GSDMD and MLKL.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide a roadmap for personalized patient 
stratification, enabling clinicians to develop personalized treatment plans for

The Pfaffia glomerata, a plant popularly called Brazilian ginseng, is widely 
used in Brazil for the treatment of various pathologies, including those 
associated with the Central Nervous System. 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), a 
phytosteroid present in this plant, can promote adaptogenic effects in the 
organism, providing greater body resistance to stressors. This study aimed to 
evaluate the phytochemical composition and the anticholinesterase, antioxidant, 
and antiglycation effects of extracts and fractions of aerial parts and roots of 
P. glomerata, also analyzing their possible cytotoxic effects. The fractions 
were obtained by partitioning methanol extracts from the aerial part and roots 
of P. glomerata with hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and 
water. The samples were initially tested in anticholinesterase, antioxidant, and 
antiglycation assays, and the most promising samples were submitted for 
cytotoxicity and chromatographic analyses. Mass spectrometry and chromatography 
methods revealed that 20E was the main compound in the dichloromethane 
fractions, there being 35% more 20E in the aerial part (APD) than in the roots 
(RD). Added to the higher concentration of 20E, the APD fraction also presented 
more promising results than the RD fraction in anticholinesterase and 
antioxidant analyses, indicating that their effects may be related to the 
concentration of 20E. These same fractions showed no hemolytic effects but were 
cytotoxic in high concentrations. These new findings contribute to scientific 
information about P. glomerata and open more perspectives for the understanding 
of its therapeutic properties, allowing the association of biological activity 
with the presence of 20E.

Autophagy impairment is a key factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. 
TFEB (transcription factor EB) and TFE3 (transcription factor binding to IGHM 
enhancer 3) are nuclear transcription factors that regulate autophagy and 
lysosomal biogenesis. We previously showed that corynoxine (Cory), a Chinese 
medicine compound, protects neurons from Parkinson's disease (PD) by activating 
autophagy. In this study, we investigated the effect of Cory on AD models in 
vivo and in vitro. We found that Cory improved learning and memory function, 
increased neuronal autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis, and reduced pathogenic 
APP-CTFs levels in 5xFAD mice model. Cory activated TFEB/TFE3 by inhibiting 
AKT/mTOR signaling and stimulating lysosomal calcium release via transient 
receptor potential mucolipin 1 (TRPML1). Moreover, we demonstrated that 
TFEB/TFE3 knockdown abolished Cory-induced APP-CTFs degradation in N2aSwedAPP 
cells. Our findings suggest that Cory promotes TFEB/TFE3-mediated autophagy and 
alleviates Aβ pathology in AD models.

BACKGROUND: Brain volume is associated with cognitive decline in later life, and 
cortical brain atrophy exceeding the normal range is related to inferior 
cognitive and behavioral outcomes in later life.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the likelihood of cognitive decline, mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), or dementia, when regional atrophy is present in participants' 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
METHODS: Multi-center MRI data of 2,545 adults were utilized to measure regional 
volumes using NEUROPHET AQUA. Four lobes (frontal, parietal, temporal, and 
occipital), four Alzheimer's disease-related regions (entorhinal, fusiform, 
inferior temporal, and middle temporal area), and the hippocampus in the left 
and right hemispheres were measured and analyzed. The presence of regional 
atrophy from brain MRI was defined as ≤1.5 standard deviation (SD) compared to 
the age- and sex-matched cognitively normal population. The risk ratio for 
cognitive decline was investigated for participants with regional atrophy in 
contrast to those without regional atrophy.
RESULTS: The risk ratio for cognitive decline was significantly higher when 
hippocampal atrophy was present (MCI, 1.84, p < 0.001; dementia, 4.17, 
p < 0.001). Additionally, participants with joint atrophy in multiple regions 
showed a higher risk ratio for dementia, e.g., 9.6 risk ratio (95% confidence 
interval, 8.0-11.5), with atrophy identified in the frontal, temporal, and 
hippocampal gray matter, than those without atrophy.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that individuals with multiple regional atrophy 
(either lobar or AD-specific regions) have a higher likelihood of developing 
dementia compared to the age- and sex-matched population without atrophy. Thus, 
further consideration is needed when assessing MRI findings.

BACKGROUND: The emergence of disease-modifying Alzheimer's (AD) treatments 
provides new hope to patients and families but concerns have been raised about 
the preparedness of healthcare systems to provide timely access to such 
treatments because of a combination of a complex diagnostic process and a large 
prevalent pool.
OBJECTIVES: We assess the preparedness of Sweden, a high-income country known 
for its dementia-friendly policies, to diagnose AD patients eligible for 
treatment within a six-month window, given current capacity for specialist 
evaluations and biomarker testing. We calculate the investment requirements for 
Sweden to achieve this target over a timeframe of 20 years.
DESIGN: Desk research to identify data for population, mortality, disease 
burden, cost of services and current capacity, expert consultation to inform 
assumptions about patient journey, and use of a Markov model to predict waiting 
times. The model simulates the patients' journey through different evaluation 
stages: initial evaluation by a primary care specialist, neurocognitive testing 
by an AD specialist, and confirmatory biomarker testing with PET scanning or 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing. The model assumes specialist appointments and 
PET scans are capacity constrained, and patients progress from cognitively 
normal to MCI and from MCI to dementia in the resulting waiting times.
MEASUREMENTS: Projected waiting times for diagnosis of eligibility for 
disease-modifying Alzheimer's treatment from 2023 to 2042 assuming current 
capacity, assuming 20% of Swedish residents aged 60 years and above would seek 
an evaluation for cognitive decline. Investments required to scale capacity up 
to reach target of providing diagnosis within six months on average.
RESULTS: Initial average waiting times for AD specialist appointments would be 
around 21 months in 2023 and remain around 55 months through 2042, as demand 
would continue to outstrip supply throughout the 20-year model horizon. Waiting 
times for biomarker testing would be stable at less than four weeks, as patients 
would be held up in the queue for their first specialist consultations, and use 
of CSF testing is widely accepted in Sweden. An additional 25% of AD specialists 
would have to be added above the current growth trend to reduce waiting times to 
less than 6 months at an average annual cost of approximately 805 million SEK. 
The increased cost of volume of biomarker testing would amount to about 106 
million SEK per year.
CONCLUSIONS: At current capacity, the Swedish healthcare system is unable to 
provide timely diagnosis of patients eligible for disease-modifying AD 
treatment. Although future diagnostic technologies, such as digital cognitive 
assessments and blood tests for the AD pathology, might decrease demand for 
capacity-constrained services, substantial investments will be required to meet 
a target of less than six months of waiting time for a diagnosis.

Glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK3-β) is a serine-threonine protease 
expressed in the brain, and its hyperactivity is considered the underlying cause 
of Alzheimer's disease. This enzyme requires an ATP molecule in its N-terminal 
lobe to phosphorylate its substrates, with the most important substrate being 
the Tau protein. This study focuses on the inhibitory mechanism of four 
naturally occurring compounds-apigenin, luteolin, rosmarinic acid, and 
salvianolic acid-from the Laminaceae family against GSK3-β. The orientation of 
the ligands within the ATP-binding pocket of GSK3-β and their binding energy 
were determined through molecular docking. Additionally, molecular dynamics 
simulations was conducted to study the conformational changes induced by the 
ligands in the protein structure. The results showed that apigenin and 
salvianolic acid achieved deeper parts of the cavity compared to luteolin and 
rosmarinic acid and formed stable complexes with the enzyme. In the rosmarinic 
acid complex, the enzyme exhibited the most exposed conformation. On the other 
hand, luteolin binding caused a small closure of the opening, suggesting a 
potentially ATP-competitive role. Our results suggest these compounds as lead 
candidates for the design of GSK3-β inhibitors.

BACKGROUND: We profiled circulating plasma metabolites to identify systemic 
biochemical changes in clinical and biomarker-assisted diagnosis of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD).
METHODS: We used an untargeted approach with liquid chromatography coupled to 
high-resolution mass spectrometry to measure small molecule plasma metabolites 
from 150 clinically diagnosed AD patients and 567 age-matched healthy elderly of 
Caribbean Hispanic ancestry. Plasma biomarkers of AD were measured including 
P-tau181, Aβ40, Aβ42, total-tau, neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Association of individual and co-abundant 
modules of metabolites were tested with clinical diagnosis of AD, as well as 
biologically-defined AD pathological process based on P-tau181 and other 
biomarker levels.
RESULTS: Over 6000 metabolomic features were measured with high accuracy. First 
principal component (PC) of lysophosphatidylcholines (lysoPC) that bind to or 
interact with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 
arachidonic acid (AHA) was associated with decreased risk of AD (OR = 0.91 
[0.89-0.96], p = 2e-04). Association was restricted to individuals without an 
APOE ε4 allele (OR = 0.89 [0.84-0.94], p = 8.7e-05). Among individuals carrying 
at least one APOE ε4 allele, PC4 of lysoPCs moderately increased risk of AD (OR 
= 1.37 [1.16-1.6], p = 1e-04). Essential amino acids including tyrosine 
metabolism pathways were enriched among metabolites associated with P-tau181 
levels and heparan and keratan sulfate degradation pathways were associated with 
Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio.
CONCLUSIONS: Unbiased metabolic profiling can identify critical metabolites and 
pathways associated with β-amyloid and phosphotau pathology. We also observed an 
APOE-ε4 dependent association of lysoPCs with AD and biologically based 
diagnostic criteria may aid in the identification of unique pathogenic 
mechanisms.

INTRODUCTION: Genome-wide association studies link susceptibility to late-onset 
Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) with EphA1. Sequencing identified a non-synonymous 
substitution P460L as a LOAD risk variant. Other Ephs regulate vascular 
permeability and immune cell recruitment. We hypothesized that P460L 
dysregulates EphA1 receptor activity and impacts neuroinflammation.
METHODS: EphA1/P460L receptor activity was assayed in isogenic Human Embryonic 
Kidney (HEK) cells. Soluble EphA1/P460L (sEphA1/sP460L) reverse signaling in 
brain endothelial cells was assessed by T-cell recruitment and barrier function 
assays.
RESULTS: EphA1 and P460L were expressed in HEK cells, but membrane and soluble 
P460L were significantly reduced. Ligand engagement induced Y781 phosphorylation 
of EphA1 but not P460L. sEphA1 primed brain endothelial cells for increased 
T-cell recruitment; however, sP460L was less effective. sEphA1 decreased the 
integrity of the brain endothelial barrier, while sP460L had no effect.
DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that P460L alters EphA1-dependent forward and 
reverse signaling, which may impact blood-brain barrier function in LOAD.
HIGHLIGHTS: EphA1-dependent reverse signaling controls recruitment of T cells by 
brain endothelial cells. EphA1-dependent reverse signaling remodels brain 
endothelial cell contacts. LOAD-associated P460L variant of EphA1 shows reduced 
membrane expression and reduced ligand responses. LOAD-associated P460L variant 
of EphA1 fails to reverse signal to brain endothelial cells.

BACKGROUND: Weight and appetite regulation have been associated with the 
expression and secretion of ATPase inhibitory factor 1 (IF1) and growth 
differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), 2 potential biomarkers for age-related 
mitochondrial dysfunction. The aim was to explore the associations between these 
biomarkers and nutritional variables in the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive 
Trial study.
METHODS: IF1 and GDF-15 plasma levels were quantified at 1-year follow-up. The 
nutritional status was measured using the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) 
score variation between baseline and 1- and 2-year visits; appetite loss was 
extracted from the MNA. Bodyweight was measured every 6 months until the third 
year and then yearly until the fifth year of follow-up, and weight loss was 
established if the loss was greater than 5% or 10% within the past 6 or 12 
months, respectively. Bidirectional associations of IF1 and GDF-15 levels with 
malnutrition, appetite, and weight loss were examined. The interactions between 
individual IF1 and GDF-15 with sex were explored.
RESULTS: Four hundred and forty-eight participants had MNA data and 1 045 had 
weight loss data. All the associations between IF1 levels and the MNA score, 
appetite loss, and weight loss were nonsignificant. Higher GDF-15 levels were 
cross-sectionally associated with appetite loss at the first year of follow-up, 
and the GDF-15 highest quartile was associated with nearly 80% higher risks of 
weight loss over 4 years. Interactions between IF1 and GDF-15 levels, and 
between these 2 markers and sex were not significantly associated with the 
outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: GDF-15 plasma levels were related to key malnutrition criteria.

structural similarities of protein-protein interfaces. The interfaces formed by 
physically interacting proteins are found from PDB if available and via PRISM 
(PRotein Interaction by Structural Matching) otherwise. The structural coverage 
of these interactions has been increased from 21 to 92% using PRISM. Multiple 
conformations of each protein are used to include protein dynamics and 
diversity. Next, we find FDA-approved drugs bound to structurally similar 
protein-protein interfaces. The results suggest that HIV protease inhibitors 
tipranavir, indinavir, and saquinavir may bind to EGFR and ERBB3/HER3 interface. 
Tipranavir and indinavir may also bind to EGFR and ERBB2/HER2 interface. 
Additionally, a drug used in Alzheimer's disease can bind to RAF1 and BRAF 
interface. Hence, we propose a methodology to find drugs to be potentially used 
for cancer using a dataset of structurally similar protein-protein interface 
clusters rather than pockets in a systematic way.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by various 
pathological changes. Utilizing multimodal data from Fluorodeoxyglucose positron 
emission tomography(FDG-PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) of the brain 
can offer comprehensive information about the lesions from different 
perspectives and improve the accuracy of prediction. However, there are 
significant differences in the feature space of multimodal data. Commonly, the 
simple concatenation of multimodal features can cause the model to struggle in 
distinguishing and utilizing the complementary information between different 
modalities, thus affecting the accuracy of predictions. Therefore, we propose an 
AD prediction model based on de-correlation constraint and multi-modal feature 
interaction. This model consists of the following three parts: (1) The feature 
extractor employs residual connections and attention mechanisms to capture 
distinctive lesion features from FDG-PET and MRI data within their respective 
modalities. (2) The de-correlation constraint function enhances the model's 
capacity to extract complementary information from different modalities by 
reducing the feature similarity between them. (3) The mutual attention feature 
fusion module interacts with the features within and between modalities to 
enhance the modal-specific features and adaptively adjust the weights of these 
features based on information from other modalities. The experimental results on 
ADNI database demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a prediction accuracy 
of 86.79% for AD, MCI and NC, which is higher than the existing multi-modal AD 
prediction models.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate the degree of cerebral atrophy for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), voxel-based morphometry has been performed with magnetic resonance 
imaging. Detailed morphological changes in a specific tissue area having the 
most evidence of atrophy were not considered by the machine-learning technique.
PURPOSE: To develop a machine-learning system that can capture morphology 
features for determination of atrophy of brain tissue in early-stage AD and 
classification of healthy participants or patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three-dimensional T1-weighted (3D-T1W) data were obtained 
from AD Neuroimaging Initiative (200 healthy controls and 200 patients with 
early-stage AD). Automated segmentation of 3D-T1W data was performed. Deep 
learning (DL) and support vector machine (SVM) were trained using 66-segmented 
volume values as input and AD diagnosis as output. DL was performed using 66 
volume values or gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volume values. SVM 
learning was performed using 66 volume values and six regions with high variable 
importance. 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) was trained using the 
segmented images. Accuracy and area under curve (AUC) were obtained. Variable 
importance was evaluated from logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: DL for GM and WM volume values, accuracy 0.6; SVM for all volume 
values, accuracy 0.82 and AUC 0.81; DL for all volume values, accuracy 0.82 and 
AUC 0.8; 3D-CNN using segmental images of the whole brain, accuracy 0.5 and AUC 
0.51. SVM using volume values of six regions, accuracy 0.82; image-based 3D-CNN, 
highest accuracy 0.69.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that atrophic features are more considerable than 
morphological features in the early detection of AD.

Data regarding Alzheimer's disease (AD) occurrence in farming populations is 
lacking. This study aimed to investigate whether, among the entire French farm 
manager (FM) workforce, certain agricultural activities are more strongly 
associated with AD than others, using nationwide data from the TRACTOR (Tracking 
and monitoring occupational risks in agriculture) project. Administrative health 
insurance data (digital electronic health/medical records and insurance claims) 
for the entire French agricultural workforce, over the period 2002-2016, on the 
entire mainland France were used to estimate the risk of AD for 26 agricultural 
activities with Cox proportional hazards model. For each analysis (one for each 
activity), the exposed group included all FMs that performed the activity of 
interest (e.g. crop farming), while the reference group included all FMs who did 
not carry out the activity of interest (e.g. FMs that never farmed crops between 
2002 and 2016). There were 5067 cases among 1,036,069 FMs who worked at least 
one year between 2002 and 2016. Analyses showed higher risks of AD for crop 
farming (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.72 [3.47-3.98]), viticulture (HR = 1.29 
[1.18-1.42]), and fruit arboriculture (HR = 1.36 [1.15-1.62]). By contrast, 
lower risks of AD were found for several animal farming types, in particular for 
poultry and rabbit farming (HR = 0.29 [0.20-0.44]), ovine and caprine farming 
(HR = 0.50 [0.41-0.61]), mixed dairy and cow farming (HR = 0.46 [0.37-0.57]), 
dairy farming (HR = 0.67 [0.61-0.73]), and pig farming (HR = 0.30 [0.18-0.52]). 
This study shed some light on the association between a wide range of 
agricultural activities and AD in the entire French FMs population.

BACKGROUND: During the past two decades, the correlation between oxidative 
stress and a variety of serious illnesses such as atherosclerosis, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Alzheimer disease (AD) and cancer has been 
established. Medicinal plants and their derived phytochemicals have proven 
efficacy against free radicals and their associated diseases. The current work 
was aimed to evaluate the phytochemical constituents of Rhamnus pentapomica R. 
Parker via Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) and its antioxidant and 
anti-glioblastoma potentials.
METHODS: The bioactive compounds were analysed in Rhamnus pentapomica R. Parker 
stem bark extracts by GC-MS analysis, and to evaluate their antioxidant and 
anti-glioblastoma effects following standard procedures. The stem bark was 
extracted with 80% methanol for 14 days to get crude methanolic extract (Rp.Cme) 
followed by polarity directed fractionation using solvents including ethyl 
acetate, chloroform, butanol to get ethyl acetate fraction (Rp.EtAc), chloroform 
fraction (Rp.Chf) and butanol fraction (Rp.Bt) respectively. Antioxidant assay 
was performed using DPPH free radicals and cell viability assay against U87 
glioblastoma cancer cell lines was performed via MTT assay.
RESULTS: In GC-MS analysis, thirty-one compounds were detected in Rp.Cme, 22 in 
Rp.Chf, 24 in Rp.EtAc and 18 compounds were detected in Rp.Bt. Among the 
identified compounds in Rp.Cme, 9-Octadecenoic acid (Z)-methyl ester (7.73%), 
Octasiloxane (5.13%) and Heptasiloxane (5.13%), Hexadecanoic acid, methyl ester 
(3.76%) and Pentadecanoic acid, 14-methyl-, methyl Ester (3.76%) were highly 
abundant.. In Rp.Chf, Benzene, 1,3-dimethyl- (3.24%) and in Rp.EtAc Benzene, 
1,3-dimethyl-(11.29%) were highly abundant compounds. Antioxidant studies 
revealed that Rp.Cme and Rp.EtAc exhibit considerable antioxidant potentials 
with IC50 values of 153.53 μg/ml and 169.62 μg/ml respectively. Both fractions 
were also highly effective against glioblastoma cells with IC50 of 147.64 μg/ml 
and 76.41ug/ml respectively.
CONCLUSION: Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of important 
metabolites which might be active against free radicals and glioblastoma cells. 
Various samples of the plant exhibited considerable antioxidant and 
anti-glioblastoma potentials warranting further detailed studies.

PURPOSE: To compare the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL), retinal 
nerve fiber layer (RNFL), and ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness measurement 
in early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and controls using spectral domain 
optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). We also assessed the relationship between 
SD-OCT measurements and cognitive measures, serum biomarkers for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), and cerebral microstructural volume.
METHODS: pRNFL, RNFL, and GCC thicknesses were measured in 43 EOAD and 42 
controls using SD-OCT. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental 
State Examination (MMSE) were used to assess cognitive status, magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) tool was used to quantify cerebral microstructural 
volume, and serum biomarkers were quantified from peripheral blood.
RESULTS: EOAD patients had thinner pRNFL (P < 0.001), RNFL (P = 0.008), and GCC 
(P = 0.018) thicknesses compared to controls after adjusting for multiple 
factors. pRNFL thickness correlated (P = 0.016) with serum t-tau level. Serum 
Aβ42 (P < 0.05) concentration correlated with RNFL thickness. Importantly, 
occipital lobe volume (P = 0.010) correlated with GCC thicknesses in EOAD 
patients.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that retinal thickness may be useful markers 
for assessing neurodegenerative process in EOAD.

SARS-CoV-2 caused the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 may elevate the risk of 
cognitive impairment and even cause dementia in infected individuals; it may 
accelerate cognitive decline in elderly patients with dementia, possibly in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. However, the mechanisms underlying the 
interplay between AD and COVID-19 are still unclear. To investigate the 
underlying mechanisms and associations between AD progression and SARS-CoV-2 
infection, we conducted a series of bioinformatics research into 
SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, COVID-19 patients, AD patients, and 
SARS-CoV-2-infected AD patients. We identified the common differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) in COVID-19 patients, AD patients, and 
SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, and these DEGs are enriched in certain pathways, such 
as immune responses and cytokine storms. We constructed the gene interaction 
network with the signaling transduction module in the center and identified 
IRF7, STAT1, STAT2, and OAS1 as the hub genes. We also checked the correlations 
between several key transcription factors and the SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 
pathway-related genes. We observed that ACE2 expression is positively correlated 
with IRF7 expression in AD and coronavirus infections, and interestingly, IRF7 
is significantly upregulated in response to different RNA virus infections. 
Further snRNA-seq analysis indicates that NRGN neurons or endothelial cells may 
be responsible for the increase in ACE2 and IRF7 expression after SARS-CoV-2 
infection. The positive correlation between ACE2 and IRF7 expressions is 
confirmed in the hippocampal formation (HF) of SARS-CoV-2-infected AD patients. 
Our findings could contribute to the investigation of the molecular mechanisms 
underlying the interplay between AD and COVID-19 and to the development of 
effective therapeutic strategies for AD patients with COVID-19.

Dual-3DM(3)AD: Mixed Transformer Based Semantic Segmentation and Triplet 
Pre-Processing for Early Multi-Class Alzheimer's Diagnosis.

Khan AA, Mahendran RK, Perumal K, Faheem M.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a widespread, chronic, irreversible, and 
degenerative condition, and its early detection during the prodromal stage is of 
utmost importance. Typically, AD studies rely on single data modalities, such as 
MRI or PET, for making predictions. Nevertheless, combining metabolic and 
structural data can offer a comprehensive perspective on AD staging analysis. To 
address this goal, this paper introduces an innovative multi-modal fusion-based 
approach named as Dual-3DM3-AD. This model is proposed for an accurate and early 
Alzheimer's diagnosis by considering both MRI and PET image scans. Initially, we 
pre-process both images in terms of noise reduction, skull stripping and 3D 
image conversion using Quaternion Non-local Means Denoising Algorithm (QNLM), 
Morphology function and Block Divider Model (BDM), respectively, which enhances 
the image quality. Furthermore, we have adapted Mixed-transformer with Furthered 
U-Net for performing semantic segmentation and minimizing complexity. 
Dual-3DM3-AD model is consisted of multi-scale feature extraction module for 
extracting appropriate features from both segmented images. The extracted 
features are then aggregated using Densely Connected Feature Aggregator Module 
(DCFAM) to utilize both features. Finally, a multi-head attention mechanism is 
adapted for feature dimensionality reduction, and then the softmax layer is 
applied for multi-class Alzheimer's diagnosis. The proposed Dual-3DM3-AD model 
is compared with several baseline approaches with the help of several 
performance metrics. The final results unveil that the proposed work achieves 
98% of accuracy, 97.8% of sensitivity, 97.5% of specificity, 98.2% of f-measure, 
and better ROC curves, which outperforms other existing models in multi-class 
Alzheimer's diagnosis.

Medical therapies to avoid the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are 
limited to date. Certain diets have been associated with a lower incidence of 
neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, the regular intake of foods rich in 
polyphenols, such as epicatechin (EC), could help prevent or mitigate AD 
progression. This work aims to explore the neuroprotective effects of EC using 
different transgenic strains of Caenorhabditis elegans, which express human 
Aβ1-42 peptides and contribute to elucidating the mechanisms involved in the 
effects of EC in AD. The performed assays indicate that this flavan-3-ol was 
able to reduce the signs of β-amyloid accumulation in C. elegans, improving 
motility and chemotaxis and increasing survival in transgenic strain peptide 
producers compared to nematodes not treated with EC. The neuroprotective effects 
exhibited by EC in C. elegans could be explained by the modulation of 
inflammation and stress-associated genes, as well as autophagy, microgliosis, 
and heat shock signaling pathways, involving the regulation of cpr-5, epg-8, 
ced-7, ZC239.12, and hsp-16 genes. Overall, the results obtained in this study 
support the protective effects of epicatechin against Aβ-induced toxicity.

BACKGROUND: Non-pharmacological interventions effective for depressive mood and 
bilateral relationships among persons with cognitive impairment (PwCI) and their 
family caregivers (FCGs) have not been established.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the feasibility of a newly developed group-based art 
appreciation and self-expression program (NCGG-ART) for dyads of PwCI and their 
FCGs.
METHODS: This pilot randomized control trial included 34 dyads of PwCI diagnosed 
with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment, and 
their FCGs, from an outpatient rehabilitation service (Holistic Physio-Cognitive 
Rehabilitation [HPCR]). Participants were randomly divided equally into the HPCR 
(control group) or NCGG-ART and HPCR (intervention group) groups. Both included 
1-hour weekly, 6-week programs. The primary outcome was depressive symptoms 
among FCGs assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). 
Feasibility outcomes included participant satisfaction and motivation. FCGs were 
interviewed about their experiences and feelings regarding the program, which 
were analyzed using content analysis.
RESULTS: Thirty-two dyads (intervention group:16; control group:16) completed 
the study period. High participation rates, satisfaction, and motivation were 
demonstrated throughout the intervention. Scores in the PHQ-9 among FCGs did not 
show positive effects: mean changes in the score were 1.3 for the intervention 
group and -0.8 for the control group (Cohen d:0.56). However, the qualitative 
analysis revealed favorable experiences and feelings of the FCGs, such as 
positive emotions, social interactions, and person-centered attitudes to and 
positive relationships with PwCI.
CONCLUSIONS: This program demonstrated high feasibility with FCGs' favorable 
responses to emotions and relationships with PwCI, ensuring future 
investigations with a confirmatory study design.

The medial temporal lobe (MTL) cortex, located adjacent to the hippocampus, is 
crucial for memory and prone to the accumulation of certain neuropathologies 
such as Alzheimer's disease neurofibrillary tau tangles. The MTL cortex is 
composed of several subregions which differ in their functional and 
cytoarchitectonic features. As neuroanatomical schools rely on different 
cytoarchitectonic definitions of these subregions, it is unclear to what extent 
their delineations of MTL cortex subregions overlap. Here, we provide an 
overview of cytoarchitectonic definitions of the cortices that make up the 
parahippocampal gyrus (entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices) and the adjacent 
Brodmann areas (BA) 35 and 36, as provided by four neuroanatomists from 
different laboratories, aiming to identify the rationale for overlapping and 
diverging delineations. Nissl-stained series were acquired from the temporal 
lobes of three human specimens (two right and one left hemisphere). Slices (50 
µm thick) were prepared perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus 
spanning the entire longitudinal extent of the MTL cortex. Four neuroanatomists 
annotated MTL cortex subregions on digitized (20X resolution) slices with 5 mm 
spacing. Parcellations, terminology, and border placement were compared among 
neuroanatomists. Cytoarchitectonic features of each subregion are described in 
detail. Qualitative analysis of the annotations showed higher agreement in the 
definitions of the entorhinal cortex and BA35, while definitions of BA36 and the 
parahippocampal cortex exhibited less overlap among neuroanatomists. The degree 
of overlap of cytoarchitectonic definitions was partially reflected in the 
neuroanatomists' agreement on the respective delineations. Lower agreement in 
annotations was observed in transitional zones between structures where seminal 
cytoarchitectonic features are expressed more gradually. The results highlight 
that definitions and parcellations of the MTL cortex differ among 
neuroanatomical schools and thereby increase understanding of why these 
differences may arise. This work sets a crucial foundation to further advance 
anatomically-informed human neuroimaging research on the MTL cortex.

Effective therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are in great demand 
worldwide. In our previous work, we responded to this need by synthesizing novel 
drug candidates consisting of 4-amino-2,3-polymethylenequinolines conjugated 
with butylated hydroxytoluene via fixed-length alkylimine or alkylamine linkers 
(spacers) and studying their bioactivities pertaining to AD treatment. Here, we 
report significant extensions of these studies, including the use of 
variable-length spacers and more detailed biological characterizations. 
Conjugates were potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE, the most active 
was 17d IC50 15.1 ± 0.2 nM) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE, the most active was 
18d: IC50 5.96 ± 0.58 nM), with weak inhibition of off-target carboxylesterase. 
Conjugates with alkylamine spacers were more effective cholinesterase inhibitors 
than alkylimine analogs. Optimal inhibition for AChE was exhibited by 
cyclohexaquinoline and for BChE by cycloheptaquinoline. Increasing spacer length 
elevated the potency against both cholinesterases. Structure-activity 
relationships agreed with docking results. Mixed-type reversible AChE 
inhibition, dual docking to catalytic and peripheral anionic sites, and 
propidium iodide displacement suggested the potential of hybrids to block 
AChE-induced β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation. Hybrids also exhibited the inhibition 
of Aβ self-aggregation in the thioflavin test; those with a hexaquinoline ring 
and C8 spacer were the most active. Conjugates demonstrated high antioxidant 
activity in ABTS and FRAP assays as well as the inhibition of luminol 
chemiluminescence and lipid peroxidation in mouse brain homogenates. 
Quantum-chemical calculations explained antioxidant results. Computed ADMET 
profiles indicated favorable blood-brain barrier permeability, suggesting the 
CNS activity potential. Thus, the conjugates could be considered promising 
multifunctional agents for the potential treatment of AD.

Mild cognitive impairment is considered the prodromal stage of Alzheimer's 
disease. Accurate diagnosis and the exploration of the pathological mechanism of 
mild cognitive impairment are extremely valuable for targeted Alzheimer's 
disease prevention and early intervention. In all, 100 mild cognitive impairment 
patients and 86 normal controls were recruited in this study. We innovatively 
constructed the individual morphological brain networks and derived multiple 
brain connectome features based on 3D-T1 structural magnetic resonance imaging 
with the Jensen-Shannon divergence similarity estimation method. Our results 
showed that the most distinguishing morphological brain connectome features in 
mild cognitive impairment patients were consensus connections and nodal graph 
metrics, mainly located in the frontal, occipital, limbic lobes, and subcortical 
gray matter nuclei, corresponding to the default mode network. Topological 
properties analysis revealed that mild cognitive impairment patients exhibited 
compensatory changes in the frontal lobe, while abnormal cortical-subcortical 
circuits associated with cognition were present. Moreover, the combination of 
multidimensional brain connectome features using multiple kernel-support vector 
machine achieved the best classification performance in distinguishing mild 
cognitive impairment patients and normal controls, with an accuracy of 84.21%. 
Therefore, our findings are of significant importance for developing potential 
brain imaging biomarkers for early detection of Alzheimer's disease and 
understanding the neuroimaging mechanisms of the disease.

Little is known about empathy changes from the early stages of Alzheimer's 
Disease (AD) continuum. The aim of this study is to investigate empathy across 
AD spectrum from Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD) to Mild Cognitive Impairment 
(MCI) and AD dementia (AD-d). Forty-five SCD, 83 MCI and 80 AD-d patients were 
included. Empathy was assessed by Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) 
(Perspective Taking - PT, Fantasy - FT, Empathic Concern - EC, and Personal 
Distress - PD), rated by caregivers before (T0) and after (T1) cognitive 
symptoms' onset. IRI was also administered to SCD patients to have a 
self-reported empathy evaluation. Facial emotion recognition was assessed by 
Ekman-60 Faces Test. Twenty-two SCD, 54 MCI and 62 AD-d patients underwent CSF 
biomarkers analysis and were classified as carriers of AD pathology (AP+) when 
they were A+/T+ (regardless of N), or non-carriers (AP-) when they were A- 
(regardless of T and N), or A+/T-/N-, or A+/T-/N+ according to the A/T(N) 
system. Cerebral FDG-PET SPM analysis was used to explore neural correlates 
underlying empathy deficits. PD scores significantly increased from T0 to T1 in 
SCD, MCI and AD-d (p < .001), while PT scores decreased in MCI and in AD-d 
(p < .001). SCD AP+ showed a greater increase in PD scores over time (ΔPD 
T0 - T1) than SCD AP- (p < .001). SCD self-reported PT scores were lower than 
those of general Italian population (14.94 ± 3.94, 95% C.I. [13.68-16.20] vs 
17.70 ± 4.36, 95% C.I. [17.30-18.10]). In AD continuum (SCD AP+, MCI AP+, AD-d), 
a positive correlation was detected between PT-T1 and brain metabolism in left 
posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus and right frontal gyri; a negative 
correlation was found between ΔPT and brain metabolism in bilateral posterior 
cingulate gyri. PT may be subtly involved since the preclinical phase of AD. 
Changes over time of PD are influenced by the underlying Alzheimer's pathology 
and could potentially serve as an early AD neuropsychological marker.

BACKGROUND: To date, there is no high throughput proteomic study in the context 
of Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD). Here, we aimed to characterize 
early CSF proteome changes in ADAD and leverage them as potential biomarkers for 
disease monitoring and therapeutic strategies.
METHODS: We utilized Somascan® 7K assay to quantify protein levels in the CSF 
from 291 mutation carriers (MCs) and 185 non-carriers (NCs). We employed a 
multi-layer regression model to identify proteins with different 
pseudo-trajectories between MCs and NCs. We replicated the results using 
publicly available ADAD datasets as well as proteomic data from sporadic 
Alzheimer's disease (sAD). To biologically contextualize the results, we 
performed network and pathway enrichment analyses. Machine learning was applied 
to create and validate predictive models.
FINDINGS: We identified 125 proteins with significantly different 
pseudo-trajectories between MCs and NCs. Twelve proteins showed changes even 
before the traditional AD biomarkers (Aβ42, tau, ptau). These 125 proteins 
belong to three different modules that are associated with age at onset: 1) 
early stage module associated with stress response, glutamate metabolism, and 
mitochondria damage; 2) the middle stage module, enriched in neuronal death and 
apoptosis; and 3) the presymptomatic stage module was characterized by changes 
in microglia, and cell-to-cell communication processes, indicating an attempt of 
rebuilding and establishing new connections to maintain functionality. Machine 
learning identified a subset of nine proteins that can differentiate MCs from 
NCs better than traditional AD biomarkers (AUC>0.89).
INTERPRETATION: Our findings comprehensively described early proteomic changes 
associated with ADAD and captured specific biological processes that happen in 
the early phases of the disease, fifteen to five years before clinical onset. We 
identified a small subset of proteins with the potentials to become 
therapy-monitoring biomarkers of ADAD MCs.

One of the main challenges in small molecule drug discovery is finding novel 
chemical compounds with desirable activity. Traditional drug development 
typically begins with target selection, but the correlation between targets and 
disease remains to be further investigated, and drugs designed based on targets 
may not always have the desired drug efficacy. The emergence of machine learning 
provides a powerful tool to overcome the challenge. Herein, a machine 
learning-based strategy is developed for de novo generation of novel compounds 
with drug efficacy termed DTLS (Deep Transfer Learning-based Strategy) by using 
dataset of disease-direct-related activity as input. DTLS is applied in two 
kinds of disease: colorectal cancer (CRC) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In each 
case, novel compound is discovered and identified in in vitro and in vivo 
disease models. Their mechanism of actionis further explored. The experimental 
results reveal that DTLS can not only realize the generation and identification 
of novel compounds with drug efficacy but also has the advantage of identifying 
compounds by focusing on protein targets to facilitate the mechanism study. This 
work highlights the significant impact of machine learning on the design of 
novel compounds with drug efficacy, which provides a powerful new approach to 
drug discovery.

BACKGROUND: Neuroimaging studies investigating the behavioral and psychological 
symptoms of dementia (BPSD)- such as apathy, anxiety, and depression- have 
linked some of these symptoms with altered neural activity. However, 
inconsistencies in operational definitions and rating scales, limited scope of 
assessments, and poor temporal resolution of imaging techniques have hampered 
human studies. Many transgenic (Tg) mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
exhibit BPSD-like behaviors concomitant with AD-related neuropathology, allowing 
examination of how neural activity may relate to BPSD-like behaviors with high 
temporal and spatial resolution.
OBJECTIVE: To examine task-dependent neural activity in the medial prefrontal 
cortex (mPFC) of AD-model mice in response to social and non-social olfactory 
stimuli.
METHODS: We previously demonstrated age-related decreases in social 
investigation in Tg 5xFAD females, and this reduced social investigation is 
evident in Tg 5xFAD females and males by 6 months of age. In the present study, 
we examine local field potential (LFP) in the mPFC of awake, behaving 5xFAD 
females and males at 6 months of age during exposure to social and non-social 
odor stimuli in a novel olfactometer.
RESULTS: Our results indicate that Tg 5xFAD mice exhibit aberrant baseline and 
task-dependent LFP activity in the mPFC- including higher relative delta 
(1-4 Hz) band power and lower relative power in higher bands, and overall 
stronger phase-amplitude coupling- compared to wild-type controls.
CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with previous human and animal studies 
examining emotional processing, anxiety, fear behaviors, and stress responses, 
and suggest that Tg 5xFAD mice may exhibit altered arousal or anxiety.

Tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation is a common feature of many 
dementia-causing neurodegenerative diseases. Tau can be phosphorylated at up to 
85 different sites, and there is increasing interest in whether tau 
phosphorylation at specific epitopes, by specific kinases, plays an important 
role in disease progression. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-related 
enzyme NUAK1 has been identified as a potential mediator of tau pathology, 
whereby NUAK1-mediated phosphorylation of tau at Ser356 prevents the degradation 
of tau by the proteasome, further exacerbating tau hyperphosphorylation and 
accumulation. This study provides a detailed characterisation of the association 
of p-tau Ser356 with progression of Alzheimer's disease pathology, identifying a 
Braak stage-dependent increase in p-tau Ser356 protein levels and an almost 
ubiquitous presence in neurofibrillary tangles. We also demonstrate, using 
sub-diffraction-limit resolution array tomography imaging, that p-tau Ser356 
co-localises with synapses in AD postmortem brain tissue, increasing evidence 
that this form of tau may play important roles in AD progression. To assess the 
potential impacts of pharmacological NUAK inhibition in an ex vivo system that 
retains multiple cell types and brain-relevant neuronal architecture, we treated 
postnatal mouse organotypic brain slice cultures from wildtype or APP/PS1 
littermates with the commercially available NUAK1/2 inhibitor WZ4003. Whilst 
there were no genotype-specific effects, we found that WZ4003 results in a 
culture-phase-dependent loss of total tau and p-tau Ser356, which corresponds 
with a reduction in neuronal and synaptic proteins. By contrast, application of 
WZ4003 to live human brain slice cultures results in a specific lowering of 
p-tau Ser356, alongside increased neuronal tubulin protein. This work identifies 
differential responses of postnatal mouse organotypic brain slice cultures and 
adult human brain slice cultures to NUAK1 inhibition that will be important to 
consider in future work developing tau-targeting therapeutics for human disease.

BACKGROUND: Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) are the first-line symptomatic 
pharmacologic treatment for patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Although the target organ for this group of drugs is the brain, inhibition 
of the enzyme may affect cardiac function through vagotonic and 
anti-inflammatory effects.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of ChEIs on outcomes in patients with AD who 
have experienced myocardial infarction (MI) prior to the AD diagnosis.
METHODS: Patients who had experienced MI before they were diagnosed with AD or 
Alzheimer's mixed dementia between 2008 and 2018 were identified from the 
Swedish Dementia Registry (SveDem, www.svedem.se), which was linked to the 
National Patient Registry to obtain data on MI and mortality. Cox proportional 
hazards regression model among a propensity score-matched dataset was performed 
to assess the association between ChEI treatment and clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: Of 3198 patients with previous MI and a diagnosis of AD or mixed 
dementia, 1705 (53%) were on treatment with ChEIs. Patients treated with ChEIs 
were more likely to be younger and have a better overall cardiovascular (CV) 
risk profile. The incidence rate of all-cause death (per 1000 patient-years) in 
the propensity-matched cohort of 1016 ChEI users and 1016 non-users was 168.6 in 
patients on treatment with ChEIs compared with 190.7 in patients not on 
treatment with ChEIs. In this propensity-matched cohort, treatment with ChEIs 
was associated with a significantly lower risk of all-cause death (adjusted 
hazard ratio 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.71-0.92) and a greater reduction 
with higher doses of ChEIs. While in the unadjusted analysis, ChEIs were 
associated with a lower risk of both CV and non-CV death, only the association 
with non-CV death remained significant after accounting for baseline 
differences.
CONCLUSION: Treatment with ChEIs was associated with a significantly reduced 
risk of all-cause death, driven by lower rates of non-CV death in a nationwide 
cohort of patients with previous MI and a diagnosis of AD or mixed dementia. 
These associations were greater with higher ChEI doses.
CONDENSED ABSTRACT: We assessed the association between cholinesterase 
inhibitors (ChEIs) and clinical outcomes in a nationwide cohort of patients with 
previous myocardial infarction (MI) and a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
or mixed dementi. In propensity-matched analysis, treatment with ChEIs was 
associated with a 19% reduction in all-cause death driven by non-cardiovascular 
death. The reduction in all-cause death was greater with the higher doses of 
ChEIs.

BACKGROUND: Dementia, with the most common form being Alzheimer's disease, is a 
global health issue and lifestyle-based strategies may reduce risk. Individuals 
with a family history of dementia are an important target group, but little is 
known about their attitudes and perceptions of dementia risk reduction.
OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the attitudes to and key considerations for multidomain 
lifestyle-based dementia prevention strategies in middle-aged Australians with a 
family history of dementia.
METHODS: Twenty participants (80% female; age range 47-65 years), undertook 
semi-structured phone-based interviews. Inductive thematic analysis of interview 
transcripts was conducted. Hierarchical coding frames and illustrative quotes 
were compiled and critically challenged until a final set of themes was 
produced.
RESULTS: Some participants expressed a positive attitude toward lifestyle-based 
dementia prevention. Reasons related to wanting to future proof, believing that 
risk reduction is relevant at all life stages and/or that there is always room 
for improvement. Other participants had a negative attitude, expressing that 
they were already following a healthy lifestyle, did not feel it was relevant to 
them yet, and/or held a deterministic view that dementia is random. Important 
considerations congregated on the themes of being tailored/personalized, taking 
a holistic approach, and involving small, achievable steps.
CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with a family history of dementia, a positive 
attitude to dementia prevention holds promise for intervention efforts, but in 
individuals expressing negative attitudes, further education and 
individual-level counselling may be warranted. Multidomain lifestyle-based 
preventive strategies also need to be tailored to the needs of key target groups 
to optimize appeal and effectiveness.

PURPOSE: [18F]Flortaucipir PET is a powerful diagnostic and prognostic tool for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau status definition is mainly based in the 
literature on semi-quantitative measures while in clinical settings visual 
assessment is usually preferred. We compared visual assessment with established 
semi-quantitative measures to classify subjects and predict the risk of 
cognitive decline in a memory clinic population.
METHODS: We included 245 individuals from the Geneva Memory Clinic who underwent 
[18F]flortaucipir PET. Amyloid status was available for 207 individuals and 
clinical follow-up for 135. All scans were blindly evaluated by three 
independent raters who visually classified the scans according to Braak stages. 
Standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) values were obtained from a global 
meta-ROI to define tau positivity, and the Simplified Temporo-Occipital 
Classification (STOC) was applied to obtain semi-quantitatively tau stages. The 
agreement between measures was tested using Cohen's kappa (k). ROC analysis and 
linear mixed-effects models were applied to test the diagnostic and prognostic 
values of tau status and stages obtained with the visual and semi-quantitative 
approaches.
RESULTS: We found good inter-rater reliability in the visual interpretation of 
tau Braak stages, independently from the rater's expertise (k>0.68, p<0.01). A 
good agreement was equally found between visual and SUVR-based classifications 
for tau status (k=0.67, p<0.01). All tau-assessment modalities significantly 
discriminated amyloid-positive MCI and demented subjects from others (AUC>0.80) 
and amyloid-positive from negative subjects (AUC>0.85). Linear mixed-effect 
models showed that tau-positive individuals presented a significantly faster 
cognitive decline than the tau-negative group (p<0.01), independently from the 
classification method.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that visual assessment is reliable for defining tau 
status and stages in a memory clinic population. The high inter-rater 
reliability, the substantial agreement, and the similar diagnostic and 
prognostic performance of visual rating and semi-quantitative methods 
demonstrate that [18F]flortaucipir PET can be robustly assessed visually in 
clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Long-term exposure to air pollution has been found to contribute to 
the development of cognitive decline. Our study aimed to assess the association 
between various air pollutants and cognitive impairment and dementia. 
Additionally, explore the modification effects of lifestyle and genetic 
predisposition.
METHODS: The exposure levels to various air pollutants, including particulate 
matter (PM) with diameters ≤ 2.5 (PM2.5), ≤ 10 (PM10), and between 2.5 and 10 μm 
(PM2.5-10) and nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2) were identified. An air pollution 
score (APS) was calculated to evaluate the combined exposure to these five air 
pollutants. A genetic risk estimate and healthy lifestyle score (HLS) were also 
generated. The Cox regression model adjusted by potential confounders was 
adopted to access the association between pollution exposure and cognitive 
decline, and several sensitivity analyses were additionally conducted to test 
the robustness.
RESULTS: The combined exposure to air pollutants was associated with an 
increased risk of incident cognitive decline. Compared with the low exposure 
group, the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for all-cause 
dementia, Alzheimer's dementia, vascular dementia, and mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) in those exposed to the highest levels of air pollutants were respectively 
1.07 (95% CI: 1.04 to 1.09), 1.08 (95% CI: 1.04 to 1.12), 1.07 (95% CI: 1.02 to 
1.13), and 1.19 (95% CI: 1.12 to 1.27). However, the modification effects from 
genetic predisposition were not widely observed, while on the contrary for the 
healthy lifestyle. Our findings were proven to be reliable and robust based on 
the results of sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to air pollution was found to be a significant 
contributing factor to cognitive impairment and dementia, and this association 
was not easily modified by an individual's genetic predisposition. However, 
adopting a healthy lifestyle may help to manage the risk of cognitive decline 
related to air pollution.

Mutations in the Presenilin (PSEN) genes are the most common cause of 
early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). Studies in cell culture, in 
vitro biochemical systems, and knockin mice showed that PSEN mutations are 
loss-of-function mutations, impairing γ-secretase activity. Mouse genetic 
analysis highlighted the importance of Presenilin (PS) in learning and memory, 
synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release, and neuronal survival, and 
Drosophila studies further demonstrated an evolutionarily conserved role of PS 
in neuronal survival during aging. However, molecular pathways that interact 
with PS in neuronal survival remain unclear. To identify genetic modifiers that 
modulate PS-dependent neuronal survival, we developed a new DrosophilaPsn model 
that exhibits age-dependent neurodegeneration and increases of apoptosis. 
Following a bioinformatic analysis, we tested top ranked candidate genes by 
selective knockdown (KD) of each gene in neurons using two independent RNAi 
lines in Psn KD models. Interestingly, 4 of the 9 genes enhancing 
neurodegeneration in Psn KD flies are involved in lipid transport and 
metabolism. Specifically, neuron-specific KD of lipophorin receptors, lpr1 and 
lpr2, dramatically worsens neurodegeneration in Psn KD flies, and overexpression 
of lpr1 or lpr2 does not alleviate Psn KD-induced neurodegeneration. 
Furthermore, lpr1 or lpr2 KD alone also leads to neurodegeneration, increased 
apoptosis, climbing defects, and shortened lifespan. Lastly, heterozygotic 
deletions of lpr1 and lpr2 or homozygotic deletions of lpr1 or lpr2 similarly 
lead to age-dependent neurodegeneration and further exacerbate neurodegeneration 
in Psn KD flies. These findings show that LpRs modulate Psn-dependent neuronal 
survival and are critically important for neuronal integrity in the aging brain.

BACKGROUND: APOE4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), whereas APOE2 confers protection. However, effects of APOE on 
neurodegeneration in cognitively intact individuals, and how these associations 
evolve with cognitive decline, are unclear. Furthermore, few studies have 
evaluated whether effects of APOE on neurodegenerative changes are modified by 
other AD key risk factors including age and sex.
METHODS: Participants included older adults (57% women; 77 ± 7 years) from the 
Rancho Bernardo Study of Health Aging and the University of California San Diego 
Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, including 192 cognitively normal (CN) 
individuals and 33 with mild cognitive impairment. Participants underwent 
diffusion MRI, and multicompartment restriction spectrum imaging (RSI) metrics 
were computed in white matter, gray matter, and subcortical regions of interest. 
Participants were classified as APOE4 carriers, APOE2 carriers, and APOE3 
homozygotes. Analysis of covariance among CN (adjusting for age, sex, and 
scanner) assessed differences in brain microstructure by APOE, as well as 
interactions between APOE and sex. Analyses across all participants examined 
interactions between APOE4 and cognitive status. Linear regressions assessed 
APOE by age interactions.
RESULTS: Among CN, APOE4 carriers showed lower entorhinal cortex neurite density 
than non-carriers, whereas APOE2 carriers showed lower cingulum neurite density 
than non-carriers. Differences in entorhinal microstructure by APOE4 and in 
entorhinal and cingulum microstructure by APOE2 were present for women only. Age 
correlated with lower entorhinal restricted isotropic diffusion among APOE4 
non-carriers, whereas age correlated with lower putamen restricted isotropic 
diffusion among APOE4 carriers. Differences in microstructure between 
cognitively normal and impaired participants were stronger for APOE4-carriers in 
medial temporal regions, thalamus, and global gray matter, but stronger for 
non-carriers in caudate.
CONCLUSIONS: The entorhinal cortex may be an early target of neurodegenerative 
changes associated with APOE4 in presymptomatic individuals, whereas APOE2 may 
support beneficial white matter and entorhinal microstructure, with potential 
sex differences that warrant further investigation. APOE modifies 
microstructural patterns associated with aging and cognitive impairment, which 
may advance the development of biomarkers to distinguish microstructural changes 
characteristic of normal brain aging, APOE-dependent pathways, and non-AD 
etiologies.

BACKGROUND: Although cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-β42 peptide (Aβ42) and 
phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and blood p-tau are valuable for differential 
diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from cognitively normal (CN) there is a 
lack of validated biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine how plasma and CSF protein markers 
compared in the characterization of MCI and AD status.
METHODS: This cohort study included Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) participants who had baseline levels of 75 proteins measured commonly in 
plasma and CSF (257 total, 46 CN, 143 MCI, and 68 AD). Logistic regression, 
least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and Random Forest (RF) 
methods were used to identify the protein candidates for the disease 
classification.
RESULTS: We observed that six plasma proteins panel (APOE, AMBP, C3, IL16, 
IGFBP2, APOD) outperformed the seven CSF proteins panel (VEGFA, HGF, PRL, FABP3, 
FGF4, CD40, RETN) as well as AD markers (CSF p-tau and Aβ42) to distinguish the 
MCI from AD [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.75 (plasma proteins), AUC = 0.60 
(CSF proteins) and AUC = 0.56 (CSF p-tau and Aβ42)]. Also, these six plasma 
proteins performed better than the CSF proteins and were in line with CSF p-tau 
and Aβ42 in differentiating CN versus MCI subjects [AUC = 0.89 (plasma 
proteins), AUC = 0.85 (CSF proteins) and AUC = 0.89 (CSF p-tau and Aβ42)]. These 
results were adjusted for age, sex, education, and APOEϵ4 genotype.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the combination of 6 plasma proteins can 
serve as an effective marker for differentiating MCI from AD and CN.

OBJECTIVES: This study investigates the influence of normal cohort (NC) size and 
the impact of different NCs on automated MRI-based brain atrophy estimation.
METHODS: A pooled NC of 3945 subjects (NCpool) was retrospectively created from 
five publicly available cohorts. Voxel-wise gray matter volume atrophy maps were 
calculated for 48 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients (55-82 years) using 
veganbagel and dynamic normal templates with an increasing number of healthy 
subjects randomly drawn from NCpool (initially three, and finally 100 subjects). 
Over 100 repeats of the process, the mean over a voxel-wise standard deviation 
of gray matter z-scores was established and plotted against the number of 
subjects in the templates. The knee point of these curves was defined as the 
minimum number of subjects required for consistent brain atrophy estimation. 
Atrophy maps were calculated using each NC for AD patients and matched healthy 
controls (HC). Two readers rated the extent of mesiotemporal atrophy to 
discriminate AD/HC.
RESULTS: The maximum knee point was at 15 subjects. For 21 AD/21 HC, a 
sufficient number of subjects were available in each NC for validation. Readers 
agreed on the AD diagnosis in all cases (Kappa for the extent of atrophy, 0.98). 
No differences in diagnoses between NCs were observed (intraclass correlation 
coefficient, 0.91; Cochran's Q, p = 0.19).
CONCLUSION: At least 15 subjects should be included in age- and sex-specific 
normal templates for consistent brain atrophy estimation. In the study's 
context, qualitative interpretation of regional atrophy allows reliable AD 
diagnosis with a high inter-reader agreement, irrespective of the NC used.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: The influence of normal cohorts (NCs) on automated 
brain atrophy estimation, typically comparing individual scans to NCs, remains 
largely unexplored. Our study establishes the minimum number of NC-subjects 
needed and demonstrates minimal impact of different NCs on regional atrophy 
estimation.
KEY POINTS: • Software-based brain atrophy estimation often relies on normal 
cohorts for comparisons. • At least 15 subjects must be included in an age- and 
sex-specific normal cohort. • Using different normal cohorts does not influence 
regional atrophy estimation.

BACKGROUND: While symptoms related to lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) are 
common in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), pathophysiological links 
between AD and LUTD remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate whether AD neuropathology would cause 
autonomic dysfunction along the spinal cord-bladder axis, which could result in 
alterations in bladder muscle kinetics.
METHODS: We utilized APPNL-G-F/NL-G-F knock-in (APP KI) and APPwt/wt (wild-type) 
mice at two different ages, 4- and 10-month-old, to investigate how AD impacts 
bladder tissue function by immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and 
pharmacomyography.
RESULTS: We showed that the mucosal layer partially separated from the detrusor 
in 10-month-old APP KI mouse bladders. Although there was no detectable amyloid 
deposition in the APP KI bladder, we found amyloid plaques in APP KI lumbar 
spinal cord. Further immunoblot analysis revealed that tyrosine hydroxylase 
protein levels were significantly reduced in both 4- and 10-month-old bladder 
tissues, suggesting reduction of norepinephrine synthesis in APP KI mouse 
bladders. In contrast, the level of β2 adrenergic receptor was increased in 
4-month-old but not 10-month-old APP KI bladders. In bladder strips, the 
adrenergic agonist isoproterenol induced increased relaxation in 4- but not 
10-month-old APP KI bladders. With 10 Hz electrical field stimulation, 
10-month-old APP KI bladder strips were more responsive than wild-type controls, 
with no differences observed in 4-month-old APP KI bladders.
CONCLUSIONS: APP KI mice exhibit LUTD, which is likely arising from amyloid 
pathology in the spinal cord, and results in maturational declines in 
presynaptic activity combined with compensatory postsynaptic upregulation.

BACKGROUND: Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction could favor the pathogenesis 
and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Vascular risk factors (VRF) could 
worsen BBB integrity, thus promoting neurode generation.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate BBB permeability and its relation with VRF along the 
AD continuum (ADc). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Amyloid (A) and p-tau (T) levels 
were used to stratify patients.
METHODS: We compared CSF/plasma albumin ratio (QAlb) of 131 AD patients and 24 
healthy controls (HC). APOE genotype and VRF were evaluated for each patient. 
Spearman's Rho correlation was used to investigate the associations between Qalb 
and CSF AD biomarkers. Multivariate regression analyses were conducted to 
explore the relationship between Qalb and AD biomarkers, sex, age, cognitive 
status, and VRF.
RESULTS: QAlb levels did not show significant difference between ADc patients 
and HC (p = 0.984). However, QAlb was significantly higher in A + T-compared to 
A + T+ (p = 0.021). In ADc, CSF p-tau demonstrated an inverse correlation with 
QAlb, a finding confirmed in APOE4 carriers (p = 0.002), but not in APOE3. 
Furthermore, in APOE4 carriers, sex, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia were 
associated with QAlb (p = 0.004, p = 0.038, p = 0.038, respectively), whereas 
only sex showed an association in APOE3 carriers (p = 0.026).
CONCLUSIONS: BBB integrity is preserved in ADc. Among AT categories, A + T-have 
a more permeable BBB than A + T+. In APOE4 carriers, CSF p-tau levels display an 
inverse association with BBB permeability, which in turn, seems to be affected 
by VRF. These data suggest a possible relationship between BBB efficiency, VRF 
and CSF p-tau levels depending on APOE genotype.

PICALM (phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein) mutations have 
been linked to a number of human disorders, including leukemia, Alzheimer's 
disease, and Parkinson's disease. Nevertheless, the effect of PICALM on cancer, 
particularly on prognosis and immune infiltration in individuals with BRCA, is 
unknown. We obtained the data of breast cancer patients from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas (TCGA) database, and analyzed the expression of PICALM in breast cancer, 
its impact on survival' and its role in tumor immune invasion. Finally, in vitro 
cellular experiments were performed to validate the results. Research has found 
that PICALM expression was shown to be downregulated in BRCA and to be 
substantially linked with clinical stage, histological type, PAM50, and age. 
PICALM downregulation was linked to a lower overall survival (OS) and 
disease-specific survival (DSS) in BRCA patients. A multivariate Cox analysis 
revealed that PICALM is an independent predictor of OS. The enriched pathways 
revealed by functional enrichment analysis included oxidative phosphorylation, 
angiogenesis, the TGF signaling pathway, and the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling 
system. Furthermore, the amount of immune cell infiltration by B cells, 
eosinophils, mast cells, neutrophils, and T cells was positively linked with 
PICALM expression. Finally, we experimentally verified that low expression of 
PICALM can reduce proliferation, migration, and invasion in tumor cells. This 
evidence shows that PICALM expression impacts prognosis, immune infiltration, 
and pathway expression in breast cancer patients, and it might be a potential 
predictive biomarker for the disease.

The burden of neurological illnesses on global health is significant. Our 
perception of the molecular and biological mechanisms underlying intellectual 
processing and behavior has significantly advanced over the last few decades, 
laying the groundwork for potential therapies for various neurodegenerative 
diseases. A growing body of literature reveals that most neurodegenerative 
diseases could be due to the gradual failure of neurons in the brain's 
neocortex, hippocampus, and various subcortical areas. Research on various 
experimental models has uncovered several gene components to understand the 
pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. One among them is the brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which performs several vital functions, enhancing 
synaptic plasticity and assisting in the emergence of long-term thoughts. The 
pathophysiology of some neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, 
Parkinson's, Schizophrenia, and Huntington's, has been linked to BDNF. According 
to numerous research, high levels of BDNF are connected to a lower risk of 
developing a neurodegenerative disease. As a result, we want to concentrate on 
BDNF in this article and outline its protective role against neurological 
disorders.

AIM: The objective of this study is to explore the impact and underlying 
mechanism of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi stem and leaf flavonoids (SSFs) on 
cognitive impairment caused by intracerebroventricular injection of okadaic acid 
(OA) in rats.
METHODS: An experimental model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) was induced in rats 
by intracerebroventricular injection of OA, resulting in memory impairment. The 
Morris water maze test was employed to confirm the successful establishment of 
the memory impairment model. The rats that exhibited significant memory 
impairment were randomly divided into different groups, including a model group, 
three SSFs dose groups (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg), and a positive control group 
treated with Ginkgo biloba tablets (GLT) at a dose of 200 mg/kg. To evaluate the 
learning and memory abilities of the rats, the Morris water maze test was 
conducted. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was used to observe any morphological 
changes in neurons. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to measure the 
expression of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) protein. Western blotting (WB) 
was utilized to assess the phosphorylation levels of tau protein at Ser262 and 
Ser396. The activities of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and 
constitutive nitric oxide synthase (cNOS) were quantified using ultraviolet 
spectrophotometry. The levels of inflammatory factors, including interleukin-1β 
(IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), were 
measured using ELISA.
RESULTS: In rats, the administration of OA via intracerebroventricular injection 
resulted in cognitive impairment, neuropathological changes, and alterations in 
protein expression and activity levels. Specifically, the protein expression of 
ChAT was significantly reduced (P<0.01), while the phosphorylation levels of tau 
protein at Ser262 and Ser396 were significantly increased (P<0.01). Moreover, 
iNOS activity in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex exhibited a significant 
increase (P<0.01), whereas cNOS activity showed a decrease (P<0.05). 
Furthermore, the levels of IL-1β and TNF-α in the cerebral cortex were elevated 
(P<0.01), while the level of IL-6 was decreased (P<0.05). The administration of 
three doses of SSFs and GLT to rats exhibited varying degrees of improvement in 
the aforementioned pathological alterations induced by OA.
CONCLUSION: SSFs demonstrated the ability to enhance cognitive function and 
mitigate memory deficits in rats following intracerebroventricular injection of 
OA. This beneficial effect may be attributed to the modulation of ChAT protein 
expression, tau hyperphosphorylation, NOS activity, and inflammatory cytokine 
levels by SSFs.

BACKGROUND: Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) demonstrate progressive white 
matter atrophy and myelin loss. Restoring myelin content or preventing 
demyelination has been suggested as a therapeutic approach for AD.
OBJECTIVE: Herein, we investigate the effects of non-invasive, combined visual 
and auditory gamma-sensory stimulation on white matter atrophy and myelin 
content loss in patients with AD.
METHODS: In this study, we used the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 
the OVERTURE study (NCT03556280), a randomized, controlled, clinical trial in 
which active treatment participants received daily, non-invasive, combined 
visual and auditory, 40 Hz stimulation for six months. A subset of OVERTURE 
participants who meet the inclusion criteria for detailed white matter (N = 38) 
and myelin content (N = 36) assessments are included in the analysis. White 
matter volume assessments were performed using T1-weighted MRI, and myelin 
content assessments were performed using T1-weighted/T2-weighted MRI. Treatment 
effects on white matter atrophy and myelin content loss were assessed.
RESULTS: Combined visual and auditory gamma-sensory stimulation treatment is 
associated with reduced total and regional white matter atrophy and myelin 
content loss in active treatment participants compared to sham treatment 
participants. Across white matter structures evaluated, the most significant 
changes were observed in the entorhinal region.
CONCLUSIONS: The study results suggest that combined visual and auditory 
gamma-sensory stimulation may modulate neuronal network function in AD in part 
by reducing white matter atrophy and myelin content loss. Furthermore, the 
entorhinal region MRI outcomes may have significant implications for early 
disease intervention, considering the crucial afferent connections to the 
hippocampus and entorhinal cortex.

The aging brain is highly vulnerable to cellular stress, and neurons employ 
numerous mechanisms to combat neurotoxic proteins and promote healthy brain 
aging. The RNA modification m6 A is highly enriched in the Drosophila brain and 
is critical for the acute heat stress response of the brain. Here we examine m6 
A in the fly brain with the chronic stresses of aging and degenerative disease. 
m6 A levels dynamically increased with both age and disease in the brain, 
marking integral neuronal identity and signaling pathway transcripts that 
decline in level with age and disease. Unexpectedly, there is opposing impact of 
m6 A transcripts in neurons versus glia, which conferred different outcomes on 
animal health span upon Mettl3 knockdown to reduce m6 A: whereas Mettl3 function 
is normally beneficial to neurons, it is deleterious to glia. Moreover, 
knockdown of Mettl3 in glial tauopathy reduced tau pathology and increased 
animal survival. These findings provide mechanistic insight into regulation of 
m6 A modified transcripts with age and disease, highlighting an overall 
beneficial function of Mettl3 in neurons in response to chronic stresses, versus 
a deleterious impact in glia.

BACKGROUND: The South Korean government has been actively involved in plans to 
combat dementia, implementing a series of national strategies and plans since 
2008. In July 2014, eligibility for mandatory long-term care insurance (LTCI) 
was extended to people with dementia enabling access to appropriate long-term 
care including the cognitive function training program and home nursing service. 
This study aimed to investigate changes in treatment patterns for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) between July 2011 and June 2017 which spanned the 2014 revision.
METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective, observational study of patients with 
newly diagnosed AD analyzed electronic medical records from 17 general hospitals 
across South Korea. Based on their time of AD diagnosis, subjects were 
categorized into Cohort 1 (1 July 2011 to 30 June 2014) and Cohort 2 (1 July 
2014 to 30 June 2017).
RESULTS: Subjects (N=3,997) divided into Cohorts 1 (n=1,998) and 2 (n=1,999), 
were mostly female (66.4%) with a mean age of 84.4 years. Cohort 1 subjects were 
significantly older (P<0.0001) and had a lower number of comorbidities (P=0.002) 
compared with Cohort 2. Mean Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores in 
Cohorts 1 and 2 at the time of AD diagnosis or start of initial treatment were 
16.9 and 17.1, respectively (P=0.2790). At 1 year, mean MMSE scores in Cohorts 1 
and 2 increased to 17.9 and 17.4, respectively (P=0.1524). Donepezil was the 
most frequently administered medication overall (75.0%), with comparable rates 
between cohorts. Rates of medication persistence were ≥98% for 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor or memantine therapy. Discontinuation and switch 
treatment rates were significantly lower (49.7% vs. 58.0%; P<0.0001), and mean 
duration of initial treatment significantly longer, in Cohort 2 vs. 1 (349.3 vs. 
300.2 days; P<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Comparison of cohorts before and after revision of the national 
LTCI system for dementia patients found no significant difference in mean MMSE 
scores at the time of AD diagnosis or start of initial treatment. The reduction 
in the proportion of patients who discontinued or changed their initial 
treatment, and the significant increase in mean duration of treatment, were 
observed following revision of the LTCI policy which enabled increased patient 
access to long-term care.

BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are distressing for patients with 
dementia, often accelerating functional decline and nursing home placement. 
Medications such as quetiapine are used to alleviate NPS, but their side effects 
require cautious use. Liquid formulations such as quetiapine oral suspension 
suit specific populations; however, real-world data on their use in patients 
with dementia are limited.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this retrospective, naturalistic study was to provide 
preliminary data on the effects of treatment with quetiapine oral suspension on 
behavioral and psychiatric disturbances in Alzheimer's disease (AD) outpatients 
in Taiwan.
METHODS: Between January 2022 and June 2023, data were collected from 
outpatients with a diagnosis of probable AD who received treatment with Qting® 
(quetiapine oral solution 25 mg/ml). Primary outcome measures were changes in 
Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) total score and its sub-items from baseline to 
the endpoint.
RESULTS: We recruited 66 AD patients with a mean age of 72.1±7.6 years, most of 
whom were female (69.7%). Twenty-three patients had data on neuropsychological 
test and NPI scores before and after quetiapine treatment. There was no 
significant change in global cognitive function from baseline to the endpoint. A 
significant reduction in NPI total score after quetiapine treatment was noted, 
while the effect on NPI sub-items was limited. The average maintenance dose was 
1.5±0.6 ml.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated our clinical experience of the use of quetiapine 
oral solution in AD patients with NPS. Our results showed that quetiapine oral 
solution treatment significantly improved these symptoms at a relatively low 
dose.

that affect the nervous system. These are among the most challenging disorders 
in medicine. Some examples include Alzheimer's, anxiety disorders, autism 
spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. NPDs represent an 
ever-increasing burden on public health and are prevalent throughout the world. 
For most of these diseases, the particular etiopathogeneses are still enigmatic. 
NPDs are also associated with structural and functional changes in the brain, 
along with altered neurotransmitter and neuroendocrine systems.Approximately 25% 
of the total human body cholesterol is located in the brain. Its involvement in 
neuronal functions starts in the early growth stages and remains important 
throughout adulthood. It is also an integral part of the neuronal membrane, 
ensuring membrane lipid organization and regulating membrane fluidity. The main 
mechanism for removing cholesterol from the brain is cholesterol 
24-hydroxylation by cytochrome P450 46A1 (CYP46A1), an enzyme specifically found 
in the central nervous system. Although research on 24S-OHC and its role in 
neuropsychiatric diseases is still in its early stages, this oxidized 
cholesterol metabolite is thought to play a crucial role in the etiology of 
NPDs. 24S-OHC can affect neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and vascular 
cells. In addition to regulating the homeostasis of cholesterol in the brain, 
this oxysterol is involved in neurotransmission, oxidative stress, and 
inflammation. The role of 24S-OHC in NPDs has been found to be controversial in 
terms of the findings so far. There are several intriguing discrepancies in the 
data gathered so far regarding 24S-OHC and NPDs. In fact, 24S-OHC levels were 
reported to have decreased in a number of NPDs and increased in others.Hence, in 
this chapter, we first summarize the available data regarding 24S-OHC as a 
biomarker in NPDs, including schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, and 
bipolar disorder. Then, we present a brief synopsis of the pharmacological 
targeting of 24S-OHC levels through the modulation of CYP46A1 activity.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a very common disorder that affects the elderly. 
There are relatively few medications that can be used orally or as a suspension 
to treat AD. A mucoadhesive (o/w) nano emulsion of mefenamic acid was made by 
adding Carbopol 940P to the optimised drug nanoemulsion using distilled water as 
the aqueous phase (6%); Solutol HS: tween 20 (3.6%) as the surfactant and 
co-surfactant; and clove oil: TPGS (0.4%) as the oil phase and mefenamic acid as 
the drug (2.8 mg/ml). The mucoadhesive nanoemulsion (S40.5%w/v) had a particle 
size of 91.20 nm, polydispersity index of 0.270, and surface charge 
of - 12.4 mV. Significantly higher (p < 0.001) drug release (89.37%) was 
observed for mucoadhesive drug formulation in comparison to mucoadhesive drug 
suspension (25.64%) at 8 h. The ex vivo nasal permeation of 83.03% in simulated 
nasal fluid and 85.71% in artificial cerebrospinal fluid was observed. The 
percent inhibition and inhibitory concentration (IC50) of mucoadhesive drug 
nanoemulsion were found to be 91.57 ± 2.69 and 6.76 respectively. Higher cell 
viability on glioblastoma cells (85-80%) was researched for mucoadhesive 
nanoemulsion as compared to drug suspension (80-70%). Significantly higher 
(p < 0.001) drug absorption and Cmax (491.94 ± 24.13 ng/ml) of mucoadhesive drug 
nanoemulsion were observed than mucoadhesive drug suspension 
(107.46 ± 11.46 ng/ml) at 8 h. The stability studies confirmed that the 
formulation was stable at 40°C ± 2°C and 75 ± 5% RH. The authors concluded that 
the mucoadhesive mefenamic acid-loaded nanoemulsion may be an effective 
technique for treating Alzheimer's disease by intranasal route.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifaceted neurological ailment 
affecting more than 50 million individuals globally, distinguished by a 
deterioration in memory and cognitive abilities. Investigating neurotrophin 
growth factors could offer significant contributions to understanding AD 
progression and prospective therapeutic interventions.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The present investigation collected blood samples from 50 
patients diagnosed with AD and 50 healthy individuals serving as controls. The 
mRNA expression levels of neurotrophin growth factors and their receptors were 
measured using quantitative PCR. A Bayesian regression model was used in the 
research to assess the relationship between gene expression levels and 
demographic characteristics such as age and gender. The correlations between 
variables were analyzed using Spearman correlation coefficients, and the 
diagnostic potential was assessed using a Receiver Operating Characteristic 
curve. NTRK2, TrkA, TrkC, and BDNF expression levels were found to be 
considerably lower (p-value < 0.05) in the blood samples of AD patients compared 
to the control group. The expression of BDNF exhibited the most substantial 
decrease in comparison to other neurotrophin growth factors. Correlation 
analysis indicates a statistically significant positive association between the 
genes. The ROC analysis showed that BDNF exhibited the greatest Area Under the 
Curve (AUC) value of 0.76, accompanied by a sensitivity of 70% and specificity 
of 66%. TrkC, TrkA, and NTRK2 demonstrated considerable diagnostic potential in 
distinguishing between cases and controls.
CONCLUSION: The observed decrease in the expression levels of NTRK2, TrkA, TrkC, 
and BDNF in AD patients, along with the identified associations between specific 
genes and their diagnostic capacity, indicate that these expressions have the 
potential to function as biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of AD.

PURPOSE: Early and rapid diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has 
important clinical value in improving the prognosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
The hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus play crucial roles in the occurrence 
of cognitive function decline. In this study, deep learning and radiomics 
techniques were used to automatically detect MCI from healthy controls (HCs).
METHOD: This study included 115 MCI patients and 133 normal individuals with 
3D-T1 weighted MR structural images from the ADNI database. The identification 
and segmentation of the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus were automatically 
performed with a VB-net, and radiomics features were extracted. Relief, Minimum 
Redundancy Maximum Correlation, Recursive Feature Elimination and the minimum 
absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were used to reduce the 
dimensionality and select the optimal features. Five independent machine 
learning classifiers including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random forest (RF), 
Logistic Regression (LR), Bagging Decision Tree (BDT), and Gaussian Process (GP) 
were trained on the training set, and validated on the testing set to detect the 
MCI. The Delong test was used to assess the performance of different models.
RESULT: Our VB-net could automatically identify and segment the bilateral 
hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus. After four steps of feature 
dimensionality reduction, the GP models based on combined features (11 features 
from the hippocampus, and 4 features from the parahippocampal gyrus) showed the 
best performance for the MCI and normal control subject discrimination. The AUC 
of the training set and test set were 0.954 (95% CI: 0.929-0.979) and 0.866 (95% 
CI: 0.757-0.976), respectively. Decision curve analysis showed that the clinical 
benefit of the line graph model was high.
CONCLUSION: The GP classifier based on 15 radiomics features of bilateral 
hippocampal and parahippocampal gyrus could detect MCI from normal controls with 
high accuracy based on conventional MR images. Our fully automatic model could 
rapidly process the MRI data and give results in 1 minute, which provided 
important clinical value in assisted diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative disease of the central nervous 
system, and its characteristic pathological changes are closely associated with 
Aβ deposition and neurofibrillary tangles. Many studies have found that 
malignant changes in the myelin sheath and oligodendrocyte (OL) are accompanied 
by the occurrence and development of AD. Therefore, any method that can resist 
myelin sheath and OL disorders may be a potential strategy for AD.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects and mechanism of Scutellaria baicalensis 
Georgi stem and leaf flavonoids (SSFs) on the myelin sheath degeneration induced 
by Aβ25-35 combined with AlC13 and RHTGF-β1 (composite Aβ) in rats.
METHODS: A rat AD model was established by intracerebroventricular injection of 
composite Aβ. The Morris water maze was used to screen the memory impairment rat 
model. The successful model rats were divided into the model group and the 35, 
70, and 140 mg/kg SSFS groups. The myelin sheath changes in the cerebral cortex 
were observed with an electron microscope. The expression of the 
oligodendrocyte- specific protein claudin 11 was detected with 
immunohistochemistry. The protein expression levels of myelin oligodendrocyte 
glycoprotein (MOG), myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) and myelin basic 
protein (MBP), sphingomyelin synthase-1 (SMS1), and sphingomyelinase-2 (SMPD2) 
were assayed by Western blotting.
RESULTS: The intracerebroventricular injection of composite Aβ caused 
degeneration of the myelin sheath structure and was accompanied by the decreased 
claudin 11, MOG, MAG, MBP, and SMS1, and increased SMPD2 protein expression in 
the cerebral cortex. However, 35, 70, and 140 mg/kg SSFs can differentially 
ameliorate the above abnormal changes induced by composite Aβ.
CONCLUSION: SSFs can alleviate myelin sheath degeneration and increase the 
protein expression of claudin 11, MOG, MAG, and MBP, and the effective mechanism 
may be related to the positive regulation of SMS1 and SMPD2 activities.

BACKGROUND: There is evidence that aerobic exercise is beneficial for brain 
health, but these effects are variable between individuals and the underlying 
mechanisms that modulate these benefits remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to characterize the acute physiological response of 
bioenergetic and neurotrophic blood biomarkers to exercise in cognitively 
healthy older adults, as well as relationships with brain blood flow.
METHODS: We measured exercise-induced changes in lactate, which has been linked 
to brain blood flow, as well brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a 
neurotrophin related to brain health. We further quantified changes in brain 
blood flow using arterial spin labeling.
RESULTS: As expected, lactate and BDNF both changed with time post exercise. 
Intriguingly, there was a negative relationship between lactate response (area 
under the curve) and brain blood flow measured acutely following exercise. 
Finally, the BDNF response tracked strongly with change in platelet activation, 
providing evidence that platelet activation is an important mechanism for 
trophic-related exercise responses.
CONCLUSIONS: Lactate and BDNF respond acutely to exercise, and the lactate 
response tracks with changes in brain blood flow. Further investigation into how 
these factors relate to brain health-related outcomes in exercise trials is 
warranted.

BACKGROUND: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has emerged as a 
promising alternative therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its ability to 
modulate neural networks and enhance cognitive function. This treatment offers 
the unique advantage of enabling real-time monitoring of immediate cognitive 
effects and dynamic brain changes through electroencephalography (EEG).
OBJECTIVE: This study focused on exploring the effects of left parietal rTMS 
stimulation on visual-evoked potentials (VEP) and visual event-related 
potentials (VERP) in AD patients.
METHODS: Sixteen AD patients were recruited for this longitudinal study. EEG 
data were collected within a Faraday cage both pre- and post-rTMS to evaluate 
its impact on potentials.
RESULTS: Significant alterations were found in both VEP and VERP oscillations. 
Specifically, delta power in VEP decreased, while theta power in VERP increased 
post-rTMS, indicating a modulation of brain activities.
DISCUSSION: These findings confirm the positive modulatory impact of rTMS on 
brain activities in AD, evidenced by improved cognitive scores. They align with 
previous studies highlighting the potential of rTMS in managing 
hyperexcitability and oscillatory disturbances in the AD cortex.
CONCLUSION: Cognitive improvements post-rTMS endorse its potential as a 
promising neuromodulatory treatment for cognitive enhancement in AD, thereby 
providing critical insights into the neurophysiological anomalies in AD and 
possible therapeutic avenues.

Social Support Networks Among Black Caregivers of Persons With Memory Problems.

Blake JA, Fields MJ, Bowen P, Ejem D, Clay OJ.

Positive social support can predict health outcomes in populations that 
experience significant burdens, such as minority caregivers. The purpose of the 
current study was to detail the social network (SN) of 36 Black family 
caregivers (FCGs) for persons with memory problems (PWMP) and examine 
differences in SN support depending on FCG gender and relationship to the care 
recipient. Participants were recruited from the Alzheimer's family program at 
the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the local community. FCGs were 
categorized into adult children (ACH), grandchildren and in-law children, and 
friends and other relatives. FCGs described the amount of adequate support they 
receive for different types of support from their SN. Female FCGs reported 
higher levels of support overall, with the largest effect sizes including social 
(d = 0.63), emotional (d = 0.64), and financial (d = 0.38) support. The largest 
effect size comparison of caregiver relationship type was in social support, 
with the ACH group reporting the lowest levels of adequate social support 
compared to the other two groups (d = 0.48). Findings suggest that different 
types of Black FCGs face unique challenges depending on their gender and 
familial relationship to the care recipient. [Journal of Gerontological Nursing, 
50(1), 22-29.].

Alzheimer's disease has recently been classified using three biological markers 
(amyloid [A], tau [T], and neurodegeneration [N]) to help elucidate its 
progression. We aimed to investigate whether there were differences between 
cognitive function and the clinical dementia symptoms over time relative to the 
ATN classification in the amyloid-negative group. In the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, 310 participants who underwent all the 
tests required for ATN classification were enrolled. The cognitive function 
score differences (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13 
[ADAS-Cog 13], Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes [CDR-SOB], and Mini-Mental 
State Examination [MMSE]) between the groups were analyzed using the analysis of 
covariance and score changes over time with a linear mixed-effects model. In the 
cross-sectional analysis, ADAS-Cog 13 scores were higher for A-T-N+ and A-T+N+ 
than for A-T-N- (p<0.001) and A-T+N- (p<0.001). In the longitudinal analysis, 
CDR-SOB scores for A-T+N+ deteriorated faster than A-T-N- (p<0.001), A-T+N- 
(p<0.001) and A-T-N+ (p<0.001). Hippocampal atrophy progressed faster in A-T-N+ 
(p<0.001) and A-T+N+ (p=0.02) than in A-T-N-. Through this study, we discovered 
that even in individuals classified as amyloid negative, neurodegeneration with 
tau deposition exacerbates cognitive decline and worsens clinical symptoms, 
underscoring the need for continuous monitoring and observation.

Medical University, Urumqi 830011, Xinjiang, China.

OBJECTIVE: [18F] AV-45 can be produced in a simple, stable, and repeatable 
manner on the Tracerlab FXF-N platform using a self-editing synthetic procedure 
and solid-phase extraction purification method. This technique is applied to 
positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of Alzheimer's disease (AD) to 
observe its distribution and characteristics in various brain regions and its 
diagnostic efficiency for the disease.
METHODS: The precursor was subjected to nucleophilic radiofluorination at 120°C 
in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide, followed by acid hydrolysis of the protecting 
groups. The neutralized reaction mixture was purified by solid phase extraction 
to obtain a relatively pure [18F] AV-45 product with a high specific activity. A 
total of 10 participants who were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD group) 
and 10 healthy controls (HC group) were included retrospectively. All of them 
underwent [18F] AV-45 brain PET/CT imaging. The distribution of [18F] AV-45 in 
the AD group was analyzed visually and semi-quantitatively.
RESULTS: Six consecutive radiochemical syntheses were performed in this 
experiment. The average production time of [18F] AV-45 was 52 minutes, the 
radiochemical yield was 14.2 % ± 2.7% (n = 6), and the radiochemical purity was 
greater than 95%. When used with PET/CT imaging, the results of the visual 
analysis indicated increased [18F] AV-45 radioactivity uptake in the frontal, 
temporal, and parietal lobes in AD patients. Semiquantitative analysis showed 
the highest diagnostic efficacy in the posterior cingulate gyrus compared with 
other brain regions (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Intravenous [18F] AV-45 was successfully prepared on the Tracerlab 
FXF-N platform by solid-phase extraction of crude product and automated 
radiochemical synthesis. PET/CT imaging can be used to diagnose and evaluate AD 
patients and provide a more robust basis for clinicians to diagnose AD.

BACKGROUND: The taxus chinensis fruit (TCF) shows promises in treatment of 
aging-related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, its related 
constituents and targets against AD have not been deciphered.
OBJECTIVE: This study was to uncover constituents and targets of TCF extracts 
against AD.
METHODS: An integrated approach including ultrasound extractions and constituent 
identification of TCF by UPLC-QE-MS/MS, target identification of constituents 
and AD by R data-mining from Pubchem, Drugbank and GEO databases, network 
construction, molecular docking and the ROC curve analysis was carried out.
RESULTS: We identified 250 compounds in TCF extracts, and obtained 3,231 known 
constituent targets and 5,326 differential expression genes of AD, and 988 
intersection genes. Through the network construction and KEGG pathway analysis, 
19 chemicals, 31 targets, and 11 biological pathways were obtained as core 
compounds, targets and pathways of TCF extracts against AD. Among these 
constituents, luteolin, oleic acid, gallic acid, baicalein, naringenin, 
lovastatin and rutin had obvious anti-AD effect. Molecular docking results 
further confirmed above results. The ROC AUC values of about 87% of these core 
targets of TCF extracts was greater than 0.5 in the two GEO chips of AD, 
especially 10 targets with ROC AUC values greater than 0.7, such as BCL2, CASP7, 
NFKBIA, HMOX1, CDK2, LDLR, RELA, and CCL2, which mainly referred to neuron 
apoptosis, response to oxidative stress and inflammation, fibroblast 
proliferation, etc.Conclusions:The TCF extracts have diverse active compounds 
that can act on the diagnostic genes of AD, which deserve further in-depth 
study.

With the FDA approval of aducanumab and lecanemab, and with the recent 
statistically significant phase 3 clinical trial for donanemab, there is growing 
enthusiasm for anti-amyloid antibodies in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. 
Here, we discuss three substantial limitations regarding recent anti-amyloid 
clinical trials: 1) there is little evidence that amyloid reduction correlates 
with clinical outcome, 2) the reported efficacy of anti-amyloid therapies may be 
explained by functional unblinding, and 3) donanemab had no effect on tau burden 
in its phase 3 trial. Taken together, these observations call into question the 
efficacy of anti-amyloid therapies.

Blood tests are in need, in the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
as minimally invasive and less expensive alternatives to cerebrospinal fluid and 
neuroimaging methods. On these lines, single molecule array (Simoa) analysis of 
amyloid-β (Aβ42), total tau (t-tau), phospho-tau (p-tau 181), and neurofilament 
L (NfL) in the plasma samples of AD subjects, healthy controls (HC), and non-AD 
subjects was conducted. Findings from this study suggest that a panel of 
multiple plasma biomarkers (NfL, Aβ42, t-tau, and p-tau 181) combined with the 
clinical assessments could support differential diagnosis of AD and other 
dementias from healthy controls.

A Siamese-Transport Domain Adaptation Framework for 3D MRI Classification of 
Gliomas and Alzheimer's Diseases.

Yu L, Liu J, Wu Q, Wang J, Qu A.

Accurate and fully automated brain structure examination and prediction from 3D 
volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a necessary step in medical 
imaging analysis, which can assist greatly in clinical diagnosis. Traditional 
deep learning models suffer from severe performance degradation when applied to 
clinically acquired unlabeled data. The performance degradation is mainly caused 
by domain discrepancy such as different device types and parameter settings for 
data acquisition. However, existing approaches focus on the reduction of domain 
discrepancies but ignore the entanglement of semantic features and domain 
information. In this article, we explore the feature invariance of categories 
and domains in different projection spaces and propose a Siamese-Transport 
Domain Adaptation (STDA) method using a joint optimal transport theory and 
contrastive learning for automatic 3D MRI classification and glioma multi-grade 
prediction. Specifically, the learning framework updates the distribution of 
features across domains and categories by Siamese transport network training 
with an Optimal Cost Transfer Strategy (OCTS) and a Mutual Invariant Constraint 
(MIC) in two projective spaces to find multiple invariants in potential 
heterogeneity. We design three sets of transfer task scenarios with different 
source and target domains, and demonstrate that STDA yields substantially higher 
generalization performance than other state-of-the-art unsupervised domain 
adaptation (UDA) methods. The method is applicable on 3D MRI data from glioma to 
Alzheimer's disease and has promising applications in the future clinical 
diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases.

In the brain, the extracellular matrix (ECM) composition shapes the neuronal 
microenvironment and can undergo substantial changes with cerebral pathology. 
Brevican is integral to the formation of the ECM's neuroprotective perineuronal 
nets (PNNs). Decreased brevican levels were reported in vascular dementia (VaD) 
but not in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the status of brevican in clinical 
cohorts with high concomitance of AD pathological burden and cerebrovascular 
disease (CeVD) is unclear. In this study, 32 non-cognitively impaired (NCI), 97 
cognitively impaired no dementia (CIND), 46 AD, and 23 VaD participants 
recruited from memory clinics based in Singapore underwent neuropsychological 
and neuroimaging assessments, together with measurements of serum brevican. 
Association analyses were performed between serum brevican and neuroimaging 
measures of CeVDs, including white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), lacunes, 
cortical infarcts, and cerebral microbleeds. Using an aggregated score for CeVD 
burden, only CIND participants showed lower brevican levels with higher CeVD 
compared to those with lower CeVD burden (p = 0.006). Among the CeVD subtypes 
assessed, only elevated WMH burden was associated with lower brevican levels (OR 
= 2.7; 95% CI = 1.3-5.5). Our findings suggest that brevican deficits may play a 
role in early cerebrovascular damage in participants at risk of developing 
dementia.

Update of
    Res Sq. 2023 Sep 12;:

BACKGROUND: Recently, single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) analyses have revealed 
important cellular and functional features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a 
prevalent neurodegenerative disease. However, our knowledge regarding 
intercellular communication mediated by dysregulated ligand-receptor (LR) 
interactions remains very limited in AD brains.
METHODS: We systematically assessed the intercellular communication networks by 
using a discovery snRNA-seq dataset comprising 69,499 nuclei from 48 human 
postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) samples. We replicated the findings using an 
independent snRNA-seq dataset of 56,440 nuclei from 18 PFC samples. By 
integrating genetic signals from AD genome-wide association studies (GWAS) 
summary statistics and whole genome sequencing (WGS) data, we prioritized 
AD-associated Gene Ontology (GO) terms containing dysregulated LR interactions. 
We further explored drug repurposing for the prioritized LR pairs using the 
Therapeutic Targets Database.
RESULTS: We identified 190 dysregulated LR interactions across six major cell 
types in AD PFC, of which 107 pairs were replicated. Among the replicated LR 
signals, we found globally downregulated communications in the 
astrocytes-to-neurons signaling axis, characterized, for instance, by the 
downregulation of APOE-related and Calmodulin (CALM)-related LR interactions and 
their potential regulatory connections to target genes. Pathway analyses 
revealed 44 GO terms significantly linked to AD, highlighting Biological 
Processes such as 'amyloid precursor protein processing' and 'ion transmembrane 
transport,' among others. We prioritized several drug repurposing candidates, 
such as cromoglicate, targeting the identified dysregulated LR pairs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our integrative analysis identified key dysregulated LR 
interactions in a cell type-specific manner and the associated GO terms in AD, 
offering novel insights into potential therapeutic targets involved in disrupted 
cell-cell communication in AD.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore unpaid carers' experiences of 
supporting people with dementia to use social media.Methods: Unpaid carers 
(n = 234) responded to an online survey about their attitudes towards people 
with dementia using social media and any experiences supporting this usage. 
Responses to closed questions were analysed using frequency analysis; 
qualitative data were analysed thematically.Results: Fifty-five carers (23.5%) 
cared for someone with dementia who used social media. Thematic analysis 
produced four themes: (1) carers as social media navigators; (2) social media 
supports care; (3) carers as social media guardians; and (4) labour-intensive 
work. Carers valued the social connectivity and stimulation social media 
provided but remained vigilant about online safety. They carefully managed the 
online experiences of people with dementia, balancing perceived benefits with 
safety, security, and caring demands.Conclusions: These findings shed light on 
the complexities of caring in the digital age. Many carers are supporting people 
with dementia in using social media, but there is little guidance on how best to 
do this. As older adults continue to embrace social media, carers, support 
organisations, and policymakers must adapt and work with technology developers 
to ensure safe and supportive online experiences.

BACKGROUND: An association between poor oral health and cognitive decline has 
been reported. Most of these studies have considered the number of teeth as a 
criterion, only a few studies have analyzed the relationship between occlusal 
status and Alzheimer's disease (AD).
OBJECTIVE: To elucidate whether posterior occlusal contact is associated with 
AD, focusing on the Eichner classification, among an older population aged 65 
years or older in Japan.
METHODS: This study used monthly claims data of National Health Insurance in 
Japan from April 2017 to March 2020. The outcome was newly diagnosed AD defined 
according to ICD-10 code G30. The number of teeth was estimated by dental code 
data, and occlusal contact was divided into three categories, namely A, B, and 
C, according to the Eichner classification. Multivariate Cox proportional 
hazards models were used to analyze the association between a new diagnosis of 
AD and the Eichner classification.
RESULTS: A total of 22,687 participants were included, 560 of whom had newly 
diagnosed AD during a mean follow-up period of 12.2 months. The AD participants 
had a lower proportion of Eichner A and a higher proportion of Eichner C. After 
adjusting for covariates, hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) with Eichner 
B and C were 1.34 (1.01-1.77) and 1.54 (1.03-2.30), respectively.
CONCLUSION: In older people aged≥65 years old, reduced posterior occlusal 
contact as well as tooth loss have an impact on AD. This study emphasizes the 
importance of paying attention to occlusal contacts to reduce the risk of AD.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) affects ∼25% of Veterans, a 
prevalence rate double that of the general population. T2DM is associated with 
greater dementia risk and has been shown to exacerbate the impact of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) risk factors on declines in daily functioning; however, there are 
few studies that investigate these patterns in older Veterans.
OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine whether T2DM moderates the association 
between amyloid-β (Aβ) positron emission tomography (PET) and 1-year change in 
everyday functioning in older Veterans.
METHODS: One-hundred-ninety-eight predominately male Vietnam-Era Veterans 
without dementia from the Department of Defense-Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (DoD-ADNI) with (n = 74) and without (n = 124) T2DM completed Aβ PET 
imaging and everyday functioning measures, including the Clinical Dementia 
Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) and Everyday Cognition (ECog). Linear mixed effects 
models tested the moderating role of T2DM on the association between Aβ PET and 
1-year change in everyday functioning.
RESULTS: The 3-way T2DM×Aβ PET×time interaction was significant for CDR-SB 
(p < 0.001) as well as the Memory (p = 0.007) and Language (p = 0.011) subscales 
from the ECog. Greater amyloid burden was associated with greater increases in 
functional difficulties, but only in Veterans with T2DM.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher Aβ was only associated with declines in everyday functioning 
over 1 year in Veterans with T2DM. Given that people with T2DM are more likely 
to have co-occurring cerebrovascular disease, the combination of multiple 
neuropathologies may result in faster declines. Future studies should examine 
how diabetes duration, severity, and medications impact these associations.

Graph-Based Fusion of Imaging, Genetic and Clinical Data for Degenerative 
Disease Diagnosis.

Guo R, Tian X, Lin H, McKenna S, Li HD, Guo F, Liu J.

Graph learning methods have achieved noteworthy performance in disease diagnosis 
due to their ability to represent unstructured information such as inter-subject 
relationships. While it has been shown that imaging, genetic and clinical data 
are crucial for degenerative disease diagnosis, existing methods rarely consider 
how best to use their relationships. How best to utilize information from 
imaging, genetic and clinical data remains a challenging problem. This study 
proposes a novel graph-based fusion (GBF) approach to meet this challenge. To 
extract effective imaging-genetic features, we propose an imaging-genetic fusion 
module which uses an attention mechanism to obtain modality-specific and joint 
representations within and between imaging and genetic data. Then, considering 
the effectiveness of clinical information for diagnosing degenerative diseases, 
we propose a multi-graph fusion module to further fuse imaging-genetic and 
clinical features, which adopts a learnable graph construction strategy and a 
graph ensemble method. Experimental results on two benchmarks for degenerative 
disease diagnosis (Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and Parkinson's 
Progression Markers Initiative) demonstrate its effectiveness compared to 
state-of-the-art graph-based methods. Our findings should help guide further 
development of graph-based models for dealing with imaging, genetic and clinical 
data.

BACKGROUND: Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) is involved in regulating 
integrative brain function and synaptic transmission. Aberrant mGluR5 signaling 
and relevant synaptic failure play a key role in the initial pathophysiological 
mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study aims to investigate the 
association between mGluR5 availability and AD's biomarkers and cognitive 
function.
METHODS: We examined 35 individuals with mGluR5 tracer [18F]PSS232 to assess 
mGluR5 availability, and with [18F]Florbetapir PET to assess global amyloid 
deposition, and [18F]FDG PET to assess glucose metabolism. The plasma 
neurofilament light (NfL) and p-tau181 levels in a subset of individuals were 
measured (n = 27). The difference in mGluR5 availability between the AD and 
normal control (NC) groups was explored. The associations of mGluR5 availability 
with amyloid deposition, glucose metabolism, gray matter volume (GMV), 
neuropsychological assessment scores, and plasma biomarkers were analyzed.
RESULTS: The mGluR5 availability was significantly reduced in AD patients' 
hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus compared to NCs. Global amyloid deposition 
was positively associated with mGluR5 availability in the AD group and reversely 
associated in the NC group. The mGluR5 availability was positively correlated 
with regional glucose metabolism in the overall and stratified analyses. The 
availability of mGluR5 in the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus demonstrated 
a strong relationship with the GMV of the medial temporal lobe, plasma p-tau181 
or NfL levels, and global cognitive performance.
CONCLUSIONS: [18F]PSS232 PET can quantify the changes of mGluR5 availability in 
the progression of AD. mGluR5 availability correlated not only with 
neuropathological biomarkers of AD but also with neurodegenerative biomarkers 
and cognitive performance. mGluR5 may be a novel neurodegenerative biomarker, 
and whether mGluR5 could be a potential therapeutic target for AD needs to be

The advent of a super-aged society poses urgent challenges in overcoming 
age-related neurological disorders and extending a healthy lifespan. 
Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy 
bodies, and Parkinson's disease are characterized by the accumulation of 
pathogenic proteins in the brain, leading to the formation of intracellular 
aggregates known as pathological hallmarks. In the early stages of protein 
accumulation, before the onset of clinical symptoms such as cognitive impairment 
or motor dysfunction, brain inflammation begins to occur. Subsequently, neuronal 
death progresses, and clinical symptoms manifest as dementia or Parkinson's 
disease. Therefore, there is a need for early prediction of neurodegeneration 
and the development of disease-modifying drugs for pre-symptomatic prevention. 
To address this issue, we have focused on enhancing the degradation of amyloid-β 
protein by targeting Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII)/proteasome 
system and on suppressing the propagation and uptake mechanisms of α-synuclein 
by targeting fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) coupled with the long isoform 
of dopamine D2 (D2L) receptor. Additionally, our analysis of FABP knockout mice 
has revealed an increased expression of FABPs in the neurodegenerative process, 
suggesting their involvement in mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal death. 
Based on these findings, this article highlights the physiological significance 
of FABP family proteins in neurodegeneration and discusses the analysis of 
plasma biomarkers for predicting neurodegenerative disorders and the 
discriminatory methods for distinguishing between Alzheimer's disease, dementia 
with Lewy bodies, and Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, we explore the potential 
of ultra-early prediction of neurodegenerative disorders.

Despite decades of intense research, the precise etiology of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) remains unclear. In this hypothesis, we present a new perspective on this 
matter by identifying carnitine palmitoyl transferase-2 (CPT2) as a central 
target in AD. CPT2 is an enzyme situated within the inner mitochondrial 
membrane, playing a crucial role in beta-oxidation of fatty acids. It exhibits 
high sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide. This sensitivity holds relevance for the 
etiology of AD, as all major risk factors for the disease share a commonality in 
producing an excess of hydrogen peroxide right at this very mitochondrial 
membrane. We will explain the high sensitivity of CPT2 to hydrogen peroxide and 
elucidate how the resulting inhibition of CPT2 can lead to the characteristic 
phenotype of AD, thus clarifying its central role in the disease's etiology. 
This insight holds promise for the development of therapies for AD which can be 
implemented immediately.

Exploring Frequency Band-Based Biomarkers of EEG Signals for Mild Cognitive 
Impairment Detection.

Tawhid MNA, Siuly S, Kabir E, Li Y.

Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is often considered a precursor to Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), with a high likelihood of progression. Accurate and timely 
diagnosis of MCI is essential for halting the progression of AD and other forms 
of dementia. Electroencephalography (EEG) is the prevalent method for 
identifying MCI biomarkers. Frequency band-based EEG biomarkers are crucial for 
identifying MCI as they capture neuronal activities and connectivity patterns 
linked to cognitive functions. However, traditional approaches struggle to 
identify precise frequency band-based biomarkers for MCI diagnosis. To address 
this challenge, a novel framework has been developed for identifying important 
frequency sub-bands within EEG signals for MCI detection. In the proposed 
scheme, the signals are first denoised using a stationary wavelet transformation 
and segmented into small time frames. Then, four frequency sub-bands are 
extracted from each segment, and spectrogram images are generated for each 
sub-band as well as for the full filtered frequency band signal segments. This 
process produces five different sets of images for five separate frequency 
bands. Afterwards, a convolutional neural network is used individually on those 
image sets to perform the classification task. Finally, the obtained results for 
the tested four sub-bands are compared with the results obtained using the full 
bandwidth. Our proposed framework was tested on two MCI datasets, and the 
results indicate that the 16-32 Hz sub-band range has the greatest impact on MCI 
detection, followed by 4-8 Hz. Furthermore, our framework, utilizing the full 
frequency band, outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods, indicating its 
potential for developing diagnostic tools for MCI detection.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, irreversible, and 
multifactorial brain disorder that gradually and insidiously destroys 
individual's memory, thinking, and other cognitive abilities.
AREAS COVERED: In this perspective, the authors examine the complex and 
multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's disease and believe that the best approach 
to develop new drugs is the MTDL strategy, which obviously faces several 
challenges. These challenges include identifying the key combination of targets 
and their suitability for coordinated actions, as well as developing an 
acceptable pharmacokinetic and toxicological profile to deliver a drug 
candidate.
EXPERT OPINION: Since calcium plays a crucial role in the pathology of AD, a 
polypharmacological approach with calcium channel blockers reinforced by 
activities targeting other factors involved in AD is a serious option in our 
opinion. This is exemplified by a phase III clinical trial using a drug 
combination approach with Losartan, Amlodipine (a calcium channel blocker), and 
Atorvastatin, as well as several MTDL-based calcium channel blockade approaches 
with a promising in vitro and in vivo profile.

INTRODUCTION: We investigated in vivo the microstructural integrity of the 
pathway connecting the locus coeruleus to the transentorhinal cortex (LC-TEC) in 
patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).
METHODS: Diffusion-weighted MRI scans were collected for 21 AD, 20 behavioral 
variants of FTD (bvFTD), and 20 controls. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean, 
axial, and radial diffusivities (MD, AxD, RD) were computed in the LC-TEC 
pathway using a normative atlas. Atrophy was assessed using cortical thickness 
and correlated with microstructural measures.
RESULTS: We found (i) higher RD in AD than controls; (ii) higher MD, RD, and 
AxD, and lower FA in bvFTD than controls and AD; and (iii) a negative 
association between LC-TEC MD, RD, and AxD, and entorhinal cortex (EC) thickness 
in bvFTD (all p < 0.050).
DISCUSSION: LC-TEC microstructural alterations are more pronounced in bvFTD than 
AD, possibly reflecting neurodegeneration secondary to EC atrophy.
HIGHLIGHTS: Microstructural integrity of LC-TEC pathway is understudied in AD 
and bvFTD.LC-TEC microstructural alterations are present in both AD and 
bvFTD.Greater LC-TEC microstructural alterations in bvFTD than AD.LC-TEC 
microstructural alterations in bvFTD are associated to EC neurodegeneration.

Amyloid accumulation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with synaptic 
damage and altered connectivity in brain networks. While measures of amyloid 
accumulation and biochemical changes in mouse models have utility for 
translational studies of certain therapeutics, preclinical analysis of altered 
brain connectivity using clinically relevant fMRI measures has not been well 
developed for agents intended to improve neural networks. Here, we conduct a 
longitudinal study in a double knock-in mouse model for AD ( App NL-G-F /hMapt 
), monitoring brain connectivity by means of resting-state fMRI. While the 
4-month-old AD mice are indistinguishable from wild-type controls (WT), 
decreased connectivity in the default-mode network is significant for the AD 
mice relative to WT mice by 6 months of age and is pronounced by 9 months of 
age. In a second cohort of 20-month-old mice with persistent functional 
connectivity deficits for AD relative to WT, we assess the impact of two-months 
of oral treatment with a silent allosteric modulator of mGluR5 (BMS-984923) 
known to rescue synaptic density. Functional connectivity deficits in the aged 
AD mice are reversed by the mGluR5-directed treatment. The longitudinal 
application of fMRI has enabled us to define the preclinical time trajectory of 
AD-related changes in functional connectivity, and to demonstrate a translatable 
metric for monitoring disease emergence, progression, and response to 
synapse-rescuing treatment.

BACKGROUND: Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is the most common form of 
dementia; it disproportionally affects women in terms of both incidence rates 
and severity of progression. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying 
this clinical phenomenon remain elusive and ill-defined.
METHODS: In-depth analyses were performed with multiple human LOAD 
single-nucleus transcriptome datasets to thoroughly characterize cell 
populations in the cerebral cortex. ROSMAP bulk human brain tissue transcriptome 
and DNA methylome datasets were also included for validation. Detailed 
assessments of microglial cell subpopulations and their relevance to sex-biased 
changes at the tissue level were performed. Clinical trait associations, cell 
evolutionary trajectories, and transcription regulon analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: The relative numbers of functionally defective microglia were 
aberrantly increased uniquely among affected females. Substratification of the 
microglia into different subtypes according to their transcriptomic signatures 
identified a group of female-enriched and disease-associated microglia (FDAMic), 
the numbers of which were positively associated with disease severity. 
Phenotypically, these cells exhibit transcriptomic signatures that support 
active proliferation, MHC class II autoantigen presentation and amyloid-β 
binding, but they are also likely defective in phagocytosis. FDAMic are likely 
evolved from female activated response microglia (ARMic) with an APOE4 
background and compromised estrogen receptor (ER) signaling that is deemed to be 
active among most subtypes of microglia.
CONCLUSION: This study offered important insights at both the cellular and 
molecular levels into how ER signaling affects microglial heterogeneity and 
function. FDAMic are associated with more advanced pathologies and severe trends 
of cognitive decline. Their emergence could, at least in part, explain the 
phenomenon of greater penetrance of the APOE4 genotype found in females. The 
biases of FDAMic emergence toward female sex and APOE4 status may also explain 
why hormone replacement therapy is more effective in APOE4 carriers. The 
pathologic nature of FDAMic suggests that selective modulations of these cells 
may help to regain brain neuroimmune homeostasis, serving as a new target for 
future drug development.

Senescent astrocyte accumulation in the brain during normal aging is a driver of 
age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
However, the molecular events underlying astrocyte senescence in AD are not 
fully understood. In this study, we demonstrated that senescent astrocytes 
display a secretory phenotype known as the senescence-associated secretory 
phenotype (SASP), which is associated with the upregulation of various 
proinflammatory factors and the downregulation of neurotrophic growth factors 
(e.g., NGF and BDNF), resulting in a decrease in astrocyte-mediated 
neuroprotection and increased risk of neurodegeneration. We found that SerpinA3N 
is upregulated in senescent primary mouse astrocytes after serial passaging in 
vitro or by H2O2 treatment. Further exploration of the underlying mechanism 
revealed that SerpinA3N deficiency protects against senescent astrocyte-induced 
neurodegeneration by suppressing SASP-related factors and inducing neurotrophic 
growth factors. Brain tissues from AD model mice possessed increased numbers of 
senescent astrocytes. Moreover, senescent astrocytes exhibited upregulated 
SerpinA3N expression in vitro and in vivo, confirming that our cell model 
recapitulated the in vivo pathology of these neurodegenerative diseases. 
Altogether, our study reveals a novel molecular strategy to regulate the 
secretory phenotype of senescent astrocytes and implies that SerpinA3N and its 
regulatory mechanisms may be potential targets for delaying brain aging and 
aging-related neurodegenerative diseases.

Rhesus macaques develop amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques during old age, but it is unclear 
how extensively they express other pathological hallmarks of dementia. Here we 
used immunohistochemistry to examine expression of phosphorylated tau (pTau) 
protein and cytoplasmic inclusions of TAR DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) 
within the amygdala of young and old males, and also in old 
surgically-menopausal females that were maintained on regular or obesogenic 
diets. Only one animal, a 23-year-old female, showed pTau expression and none 
showed TDP-43 inclusions. What genetic and/or environmental factors protect 
macaques from expressing more severe human neuro-pathologies remains an 
interesting unresolved question.

BACKGROUND: Disturbed metabolism has been proposed as being involved in the 
pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and more evidence from human AD brains 
is required.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we attempted to identify or confirm modulations in the 
levels of metabolites associated with AD in postmortem AD brains.
METHODS: We performed metabolomics analyses using a gas chromatography mass 
spectrometry system in postmortem brains of patients with confirmed AD, patients 
with CERAD score B, and control subjects.
RESULTS: Impaired phosphorylation of glucose and elevation of several 
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) metabolites, except citrate, were observed and the 
degree of impaired phosphorylation and elevation in the levels of the TCA cycle 
metabolites were negatively and positively correlated, respectively, with the 
clinical phenotypes of AD. The levels of uronic acid pathway metabolites were 
modulated in AD and correlated positively with the amyloid-β content. The 
associations of nucleic acid synthesis and amino acid metabolites with AD 
depended on the kinds of metabolites; in particular, the contents of ribose 
5-phosphate, serine and glycine were negatively correlated, while those of 
ureidosuccinic acid and indole-3-acetic acid were positively modulated in AD. 
Comprehensive statistical analyses suggested that alterations in the inositol 
pathway were most closely associated with AD.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed many novel associations between 
metabolites and AD, suggesting that some of these might serve as novel potential 
therapeutic targets for AD.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is complex and novel approaches are 
urgently needed to aid in diagnosis. Blood is frequently used as a source for 
biomarkers; however, its complexity prevents proper detection. The analytical 
power of metabolomics, coupled with statistical tools, can assist in reducing 
this complexity.
OBJECTIVES: Thus, we sought to validate a previously proposed panel of metabolic 
blood-based biomarkers for AD and expand our understanding of the pathological 
mechanisms involved in AD that are reflected in the blood.
METHODS: In the validation cohort serum and plasma were collected from 25 AD 
patients and 25 healthy controls. Serum was analysed for metabolites using 
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, while plasma was tested for 
markers of neuronal damage and AD hallmark proteins using single molecule array 
(SIMOA).
RESULTS: The diagnostic performance of the metabolite biomarker panel was 
confirmed using sparse-partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) 
with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.73 (95% confidence interval: 0.59-0.87). 
Pyruvic acid and valine were consistently reduced in the discovery and 
validation cohorts. Pathway analysis of significantly altered metabolites in the 
validation set revealed that they are involved in branched-chain amino acids 
(BCAAs) and energy metabolism (glycolysis and gluconeogenesis). Additionally, 
strong positive correlations were observed for valine and isoleucine 
between cerebrospinal fluid p-tau and t-tau.
CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed panel of metabolites was successfully validated using 
a combined approach of NMR and sPLS-DA. It was discovered that 
cognitive-impairment-related metabolites belong to BCAAs and are involved in 
energy metabolism.

Mounting evidence suggests considerable diversity in brain aging trajectories, 
primarily arising from the complex interplay between age, genetic, and 
environmental risk factors, leading to distinct patterns of micro- and 
macro-cerebral aging. The underlying mechanisms of such effects still remain 
unclear. We conducted a comprehensive association analysis between cerebral 
structural measures and prevalent risk factors, using data from 36,969 UK 
Biobank subjects aged 44-81. Participants were assessed for brain volume, white 
matter diffusivity, Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes, polygenic risk scores, 
lifestyles, and socioeconomic status. We examined genetic and environmental 
effects and their interactions with age and sex, and identified 726 signals, 
with education, alcohol, and smoking affecting most brain regions. Our analysis 
revealed negative age-APOE-ε4 and positive age-APOE-ε2 interaction effects, 
respectively, especially in females on the volume of amygdala, positive 
age-sex-APOE-ε4 interaction on the cerebellar volume, positive 
age-excessive-alcohol interaction effect on the mean diffusivity of the splenium 
of the corpus callosum, positive age-healthy-diet interaction effect on the 
paracentral volume, and negative APOE-ε4-moderate-alcohol interaction effects on 
the axial diffusivity of the superior fronto-occipital fasciculus. These 
findings highlight the need of considering age, sex, genetic, and environmental 
joint effects in elucidating normal or abnormal brain aging.

BACKGROUND: Blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are promising to 
be used in clinical settings. The liver is an important degradation organ of the 
body. Whether liver function affects the levels of AD biomarkers needs to be 
studied.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations between liver function and the plasma 
levels of AD biomarkers.
METHODS: We conducted an ADNI cohort-based cross-sectional study. Thirteen liver 
function markers commonly used in clinical settings were analyzed: total protein 
(TP), albumin (AL), globulin (GL), AL/GL ratio (A/G), total bilirubin (TB), 
direct bilirubin (DB), indirect bilirubin (IB), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), AST/ALT ratio, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT). Liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to detect the plasma Aβ42 and 
Aβ40 concentrations. Single Molecule array technique was used to measure the 
plasma p-tau181 and NfL concentrations. We used linear regression models to 
analyze the associations between liver function markers and the levels of AD 
plasma biomarkers.
RESULTS: ALP was positively associated with the levels of plasma Aβ42 (β = 0.16, 
P = 0.018) and Aβ40 (β = 0.21, P = 0.004). LDH was positively associated with 
the levels of plasma p-tau181 (β = 0.09, P = 0.022). While NfL was correlated 
with multiple liver function markers, including AL, A/G, ALT, AST/ALT, and LDH.
CONCLUSION: Liver function was associated with the plasma levels of AD 
biomarkers. It needs to consider the potential influence of liver function on 
the reference ranges and the interpretation of results for AD biomarkers before 
clinical use.

BACKGROUND: A growing body of data suggests that balance impairment may be 
linked to the onset of dementia.
OBJECTIVES: However, a large-scale epidemiologic investigation is needed to 
clarify its association in older adults.
DESIGN: A retrospective-prospective hybrid database.
SETTING: Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the 
relationship between balance impairment and the risk of incident dementia, and 
the results were provided as adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% confidence 
intervals (CI). All participants were tracked until the date of incident 
dementia, death, or 31 December 2019 whichever came first.
PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed 143,788 older adults who had at least one health 
screening between 2009 and 2019 from the Korea National Health Insurance 
Service-Senior Cohort.
MEASUREMENTS: A total of 3,774 cases of dementia were discovered throughout 
850,425 person-years of follow-up investigation. Balance impairment was 
associated with a risk of dementia compared to those without balance impairment 
(adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.83; 95% CI, 1.69-2.00; P value <0.001).
RESULTS: Risks of the Alzheimer's disease (aHR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.65-1.96; P for 
trend <0.001) and the vascular dementia (aHR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.89-4.58; P for 
trend <0.001) showed comparable trends and findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Balance impairment was found to be independently associated with an 
increased risk of dementia in older adults.

The world's population is in a demographical transition, with an increase in the 
number of older adults and prevalence of diseases related to aging. This study 
evaluated in vitro the potential of using Durvillaea incurvata extract 
(extracted using ultrasound-assisted extraction) to inhibit key enzymes 
associated with the development of age-related diseases. Our results show that 
an extract extracted via ultrasound-assisted extracted, as well as an extract 
conventional extracted from Durvillaea incurvata, presented antidiabetes 
potential by exhibiting inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase (91.8 ± 1.0% 
and 93.8 ± 0.3%, respectively, at 500 µg/mL) and α-amylase (42.2 ± 1.4% and 61.9 
± 0.9%, respectively, at 1500 µg/mL) enzymes related to starch digestion and 
postprandial glycemic response. Also, the extracts showed inhibitory activity 
against the enzymes acetylcholinesterase (51.5% and 50.8%, respectively, at 500 
µg/mL) and butyrylcholinesterase (32.8% and 34.4%, respectively, at 0.5 mg/mL), 
the biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's disease, and angiotensin-converting 
enzyme (98.7 ± 7.4% and 93.0 ± 3.4%, respectively, at 2.0 mg/mL), which is key 
in the regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure and helps to prevent the 
development of hypertension. In conclusion, the extract of Durvillaea incurvata 
obtained from ultrasound-assisted extraction has the potential to prevent the 
development of age-related pathologies such as diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, 
and hypertension.

Evidence suggests that herpes virus infection is associated with an increased 
risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and innate and adaptive immunity plays an 
important role in the association. Although there have been many studies, the 
mechanism of the association is still unclear. This study aims to reveal the 
underlying molecular and immune regulatory network through multi-omics data and 
provide support for the study of the mechanism of infection and AD in the 
future. Here, we found that the herpes virus infection significantly increased 
the risk of AD. Genes associated with the occurrence and development of AD and 
genetically regulated by herpes virus infection are mainly enrichment in 
immune-related pathways. The 22 key regulatory genes identified by machine 
learning are mainly immune genes. They are also significantly related to the 
infiltration changes of 3 immune cell in AD. Furthermore, many of these genes 
have previously been reported to be linked, or potentially linked, to the 
pathological mechanisms of both herpes virus infection and AD. In conclusion, 
this study contributes to the study of the mechanisms related to herpes virus 
infection and AD, and indicates that the regulation of innate and adaptive 
immunity may be an effective strategy for preventing and treating herpes virus 
infection and AD. Additionally, the identified key regulatory genes, whether 
previously studied or newly discovered, may serve as valuable targets for 
prevention and treatment strategies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with a long incubation 
period. While extensive research has led to the construction of long non-coding 
RNA (lncRNA)-associated competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory networks, 
which primarily derived from differential analyses between clinical AD patients 
and control individuals or mice, there remains a critical knowledge gap 
pertaining to the dynamic alterations in transcript expression profiles that 
occur with age, spanning from the pre-symptomatic stage to the onset of AD. In 
the present study, we examined the transcriptomic changes in AD model mice at 
three distinct stages: the unaffected (un-) stage, the pre-onset stage, and the 
late-onset stage, and identified 14, 57, and 99 differentially expressed mRNAs 
(DEmRs) in AD model mice at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. Among these, we 
pinpointed 16 mRNAs closely associated with inflammation and immunity and 
excavated their lncRNA-mRNA regulatory network based on a comprehensive 
analysis. Notably, our preliminary analysis suggested that four lncRNAs 
(NONMMUT102943, ENSMUST00000160309, NONMMUT083044, and NONMMUT126468), eight 
miRNAs (miR-34a-5p, miR-22-5p, miR-302a/b-3p, miR-340-5p, miR-376a/b-5p, and 
miR-487b-5p), and four mRNAs (C1qa, Cd68, Ctss, and Slc11a1) may play pivotal 
roles in orchestrating immune and inflammatory responses during the early stages 
of AD. Our study has unveiled age-related AD risk genes, and provided an 
analytical framework for constructing lncRNA-mRNA networks using time series 
data and correlation analysis. Most notably, we have successfully constructed a 
comprehensive regulatory ceRNA network comprising genes intricately linked to 
inflammatory and immune functions in AD.

BACKGROUND: Il Paese Ritrovato is an Italian nursing home founded in 2018, it is 
based on the Alzheimer village model and admits people with mild-to-moderate 
dementia.
OBJECTIVE: Describe the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on people living at Il 
Paese Ritrovato through a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) regularly 
administered prior to and during the pandemic.
METHODS: We explored the effects of a person-centered approach. We assessed 64 
subjects (enrolled and followed between June 2018 and December 2020), who 
underwent at least 18 months of observation prior to the pandemic. Each subject 
was evaluated using a CGA on admission time (T0) and at defined time-points: T6, 
T12, T18. One last CGA evaluation was performed during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic 
(TCovid-19). Temporal trends during T0-T18, and differences between T18 and 
TCovid-19 were calculated.
RESULTS: The mean age was 82 years with a prevalence for females (77.0%) and 
Alzheimer's disease diagnosis (60%). Psychiatric and behavioral disorders were 
the most common conditions (80%). We utilized a nonpharmacological approach 
aimed at promoting the residents' overall wellbeing and observed satisfactory 
performance during the first 18 months. In comparison with the pre-pandemic 
period, TCovid-19 enlightened +11.7% use of antidepressants and a decline of 
Mini-Mental State Examination mean values (not statistically significant), while 
engagement in activities dropped.
CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic may have disrupted the existing model of care, but at 
the same time, it confirmed that the Il Paese Ritrovato approach, which 
encompasses symptoms improvement and multicomponent support, is in fact 
beneficial.

Neuronal activity can be modulated by mechanical stress in the central nervous 
system (CNS) in neurodegenerative diseases, for example Alzheimer's disease. 
However, the impact of mechanical stress on chemical signal transmission, 
especially the storage and release of neurotransmitter in neuron vesicles, has 
not been fully clarified. In this study, a nanotip conical carbon fiber 
microelectrode (CFME) and a disk CFME are placed in and on a cell, respectively. 
The nanotip conical CFME functions for both the mechanical stress and the 
quantification of transmitter storage in single vesicles, while the disk CFME is 
used to monitor the transmitter release during exocytosis induced by mechanical 
stress at the same cell. By comparing the vesicular transmitter storage with its 
release during mechanical stress-induced exocytosis at the same cell, we find 
the release ratio of transmitter in chromaffin cells varies from 27 % to 100 %, 
while for PC12 cells from 30 % to 100 %. Our results indicate that the 
exocytosis of cells responding to mechanical stress shows individual difference 
obviously, with a significant population exhibiting partial release mode. The 
variation of Ca2+ channels and mechanosensitive ion channels on cell membrane 
may both contribute to this variation. Our discovery not only shows mechanical 
stress can change the transmission of cellular chemical signals at the vesicle 
level, but also provides an important reference perspective for the study of 
nervous system regulation and nervous system diseases.

BACKGROUND: Hypertension can have deleterious effects on cognitive function; 
however, few studies have examined its effects on cognition among 
Hispanics/Latinos.
OBJECTIVE: To assess associations between hypertension status with 1) change in 
cognitive performance, and 2) having mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among 
diverse Hispanics/Latinos.
METHODS: This population-based, prospective cohort, multisite study included 
Hispanic/Latino adults aged 45 to 72 years in enrolled in the Hispanic Community 
Health Study/Study of Latinos at Visit 1 (2008-2011; mean age of 63.40±8.24 
years), and the Study of Latinos-Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging at Visit 
2 (2016-2018), with a mean follow-up duration of 7 years (n = 6,173). 
Hypertension status was assessed at both visits: normotension (no hypertension), 
incident hypertension (only at Visit 2), and persistent hypertension (at both 
visits). We examined change in cognitive performance and having MCI (only 
assessed at Visit 2) relative to hypertension status and adjusted for 
demographics and cardiovascular disease risk factors.
RESULTS: Compared to normotension, persistent hypertension was associated with 
significantly increased decline in verbal fluency (β= -0.08; CI = [-0.16;-0.01]; 
p < 0.05), and processing speed (β= -0.11; CI = [-0.20;-0.02]; p < 0.05). 
Incident hypertension was not associated with significant change in cognitive 
performance. Both incident (OR = 1.70; CI = [1.16;2.50]; p < 0.01) and 
persistent hypertension (OR = 2.13; CI = [1.57;2.88]; p < 0.001) were associated 
with significantly higher odds ratios of having MCI.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that persistent hypertension is associated 
with clinical impairment and domain-specific cognitive decline in middle-aged 
and older Hispanics/Latinos. It underscores the importance of monitoring blood 
pressure in routine healthcare visits beginning at midlife in this population to 
reduce the burden of cognitive decline.

Axonal degeneration is a key component of neurodegenerative diseases such as 
Huntington's disease (HD), Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis. Nicotinamide, an NAD+ precursor, has long since been implicated in 
axonal protection and reduction of degeneration. However, studies on 
nicotinamide (NAm) supplementation in humans indicate that NAm has no protective 
effect. Sterile alpha and toll/interleukin receptor motif-containing protein 1 
(SARM1) regulates several cell responses to axonal damage and has been 
implicated in promoting neuronal degeneration. SARM1 inhibition seems to result 
in protection from neuronal degeneration while hydrogen peroxide has been 
implicated in oxidative stress and axonal degeneration. The effects of 
laser-induced axonal damage in wild-type and HD dorsal root ganglion cells 
treated with NAm, hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ), and SARM1 inhibitor DSRM-3716 were 
investigated and the cell body width, axon width, axonal strength, and axon 
shrinkage post laser-induced injury were measured.

A growing literature suggests that plasma levels of tau phosphorylated at amino 
acid 217 (pTau217) performs similarly to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers 
and PET imaging to detect amyloid pathology and to provide diagnostic and 
prognostic information in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but a significant limiting 
factor thus far has been a lack of widely available immunoassays. We evaluated a 
novel pTau217 S-PLEX® assay developed by Meso Scale Discovery (MSD; Rockville, 
MD) in plasma from 131 individuals with AD confirmed by CSF biomarkers and 
controls. Technical performance of the assay was excellent with an LLOQ of 1.84 
pg/mL and intra/interplate CVs of 5.5% (0.3-15.0%) and 5.7% (range 0.3-13.4%), 
respectively. The pTau217 plasma assay differentiated AD and controls with an 
AUC of 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-1.0) and pTau217 levels were 3.9-fold higher in 
individuals with AD. This performance was significantly better than what was 
observed for plasma pTau181, performed in parallel, and comparable to published 
data on existing pTau217 assays. While further clinical validation and 
head-to-head comparisons are needed to fully establish the role for the novel 
pTau217 S-PLEX assay, these data demonstrate the utility of the assay to detect 
AD pathology.

BACKGROUND: Elevated amyloid-β (Aβ) on positron emission tomography (PET) scan 
is used to aid diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but many prior studies 
have focused on patients with a typical AD phenotype such as amnestic mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI). Little is known about whether elevated Aβ on PET 
scan predicts rate of cognitive and functional decline among those with MCI or 
dementia that is clinically less typical of early AD, thus leading to etiologic 
uncertainty.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether elevated Aβ on PET scan predicts 
cognitive and functional decline over an 18-month period in those with MCI or 
dementia of uncertain etiology.
METHODS: In 1,028 individuals with MCI or dementia of uncertain etiology, we 
evaluated the association between elevated Aβ on PET scan and change on a 
telephone cognitive status measure administered to the participant and change in 
everyday function as reported by their care partner.
RESULTS: Individuals with either MCI or dementia and elevated Aβ (66.6% of the 
sample) showed greater cognitive decline compared to those without elevated Aβ 
on PET scan, whose cognition was relatively stable over 18 months. Those with 
either MCI or dementia and elevated Aβ were also reported to have greater 
functional decline compared to those without elevated Aβ, even though the latter 
group showed significant care partner-reported functional decline over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated Aβ on PET scan can be helpful in predicting rates of both 
cognitive and functional decline, even among cognitively impaired individuals 
with atypical presentations of AD.

A Causality-Aware Graph Convolutional Network Framework for Rigidity Assessment 
in Parkinsonians.

Tang X, Zhang C, Guo R, Yang X, Qian X.

Rigidity is one of the common motor disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD), which 
lead to life quality deterioration. The widely-used rating-scale-based approach 
for rigidity assessment still depends on the availability of experienced 
neurologists and is limited by rating subjectivity. Given the recent successful 
applications of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) in auxiliary PD 
diagnosis, automated assessment of PD rigidity can be essentially achieved 
through QSM analysis. However, a major challenge is the performance instability 
due to the confounding factors (e.g., noise and distribution shift) which 
conceal the truly-causal features. Therefore, we propose a causality-aware graph 
convolutional network (GCN) framework, where causal feature selection is 
combined with causal invariance to ensure that causality-informed model 
decisions are reached. Firstly, a GCN model that integrates causal feature 
selection is systematically constructed at three graph levels: node, structure, 
and representation. In this model, a causal diagram is learned to extract a 
subgraph with truly-causal information. Secondly, a non-causal perturbation 
strategy is developed along with an invariance constraint to ensure the 
stability of the assessment results under different distributions, and thus 
avoid spurious correlations caused by distribution shifts. The superiority of 
the proposed method is shown by extensive experiments and the clinical value is 
revealed by the direct relevance of selected brain regions to rigidity in PD. 
Besides, its extensibility is verified on other two tasks: PD bradykinesia and 
mental state for Alzheimer's disease. Overall, we provide a clinically-potential 
tool for automated and stable assessment of PD rigidity. Our source code will be 
available at https://github.com/SJTUBME-QianLab/Causality-Aware-Rigidity.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible 
neurodegenerative disorder. It is characterized by a gradual decrease in 
cognitive function and is considered a disorder in which the intensifying 
neuronal loss. The autopsy is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of 
AD and non-AD dementia.
OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to clarify the involvement of neuroinflammation 
processes in brain lesions of AD.
METHODS: The defunct was admitted to the forensic medicine department of Issad 
Hassani Hospital (Algeria). In order to recover the brain, an autopsy was 
performed within 24 hours of death and then immediately fixed in formaldehyde to 
maintain structural brain integrity for histological and immunohistochemical 
analysis.
RESULTS: Our findings indicate the presence of tissue lesions in the specific 
brain regions: right middle frontal gyrus, right cingulate gyrus, right putamen 
and globus pallidus, right caudate nucleus, right hippocampus, inferior parietal 
lobule, left parahippocampal gyrus, and left hippocampus. Notably, there is a 
predominant occurrence of lesions: granulovacuolar degeneration, Hirano bodies, 
cotton-wool, and neuritic plaques. The causes of neurodegenerative processes are 
probably related to TNF-α, IL-1β, and TGF-β production and iNOS expression by 
the NF-κB activation pathway in the R-HP, inducing necroptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of neuroinflammatory responses is linked to tissue 
lesions in AD. The production of inflammatory cytokines is the basis of this 
process, which ultimately leads to the necroptosis, which is triggered by 
neuroinflammation amplification. The inhibition of neuroinflammation by 
targeting TNF-α/iNOS could stop tissue damage, this may be a promising 
therapeutic pathway.

Understanding whether vascular risk factors (VRFs) synergistically potentiate 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression is important in the context of emerging 
treatments for preclinical AD. In a group of 503 cognitively unimpaired 
individuals, we tested whether VRF burden interacts with AD pathophysiology to 
accelerate neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Baseline VRF burden was 
calculated considering medical data and AD pathophysiology was assessed based on 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-β1-42 (Aβ1-42) and tau phosphorylated at 
threonine 181 (p-tau181). Neurodegeneration was assessed with plasma 
neurofilament light (NfL) and global cognition with the modified version of the 
Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite. The mean (SD) age of participants 
was 72.9 (6.1) years, and 220 (43.7%) were men. Linear mixed-effects models 
revealed that an elevated VRF burden synergistically interacted with AD 
pathophysiology to drive longitudinal plasma NfL increase and cognitive decline. 
Additionally, VRF burden was not associated with CSF Aβ1-42 or p-tau181 changes 
over time. Our results suggest that VRF burden and AD pathophysiology are 
independent processes; however, they synergistically lead to neurodegeneration 
and cognitive deterioration. In preclinical stages, the combination of therapies 
targeting VRFs and AD pathophysiology might potentiate treatment outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: Identification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) needs inexpensive, 
noninvasive biomarkers, with validation in all populations.
METHODS: We collected plasma markers in older American Indian individuals: 
phosphorylated-tau181 (pTau181); amyloid-beta (Aβ) 40,42; glial fibrillary 
acidic protein (GFAP); and neurofilament light chain (NfL). Plasma markers were 
analyzed for discriminant properties with cognitive status and etiology using 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.
RESULTS: PTau181, GFAP, NfL plasma values were significantly associated with 
cognition, but Aβ were not. Discriminant performance was moderate for individual 
markers, with pTau181, GFAP, NfL performing best, but an empirically selected 
panel of markers (age, sex, education, pTau181, GFAP, NfL, Aβ4240 ratio) had 
excellent discriminant performance (AUC > 0.8).
DISCUSSION: In American Indian individuals, pTau181 and Aβ values suggested more 
common pathology than in majority populations. Aβ was less informative than in 
other populations; however, all four markers were needed for a best-performing 
dementia diagnostic model. These data validate utility of AD plasma markers, 
while suggesting population-specific diagnostic characteristics.

In recent years, we have seen the widespread devastations and serious health 
complications manifested by COVID-19 globally. Although we have effectively 
controlled the pandemic, uncertainties persist regarding its potential long-term 
effects, including prolonged neurological issues. To gain comprehensive 
insights, we conducted a meta-analysis of mass spectrometry-based proteomics 
data retrieved from different studies with a total of 538 COVID-19 patients and 
523 healthy controls. The meta-analysis revealed that top-enriched pathways were 
associated with neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's (AD) and 
Parkinson's disease (PD). Further analysis confirmed a direct correlation in the 
expression patterns of 24 proteins involved in Alzheimer's and 23 proteins in 
Parkinson's disease with COVID-19. Protein-protein interaction network and 
cluster analysis identified SNCA as a hub protein, a known biomarker for 
Parkinson's disease, in both AD and PD. To the best of our knowledge, this is 
the first meta-analysis study providing proteomic profiling evidence linking 
COVID-19 to neurological complications.

Heterocephalus glaber, known as the Naked mole-rat, has an extraordinary 
immunity to Alzheimer's disease. The pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's 
disease is cerebral accumulations of plaques, consisting of self-aggregated 
amyloid beta peptides. Homo sapiens and H. glaber amyloid beta peptides are 
different in only one amino acid. Herein, computational structural analyses were 
carried out to determine whether plaque development in H. glaber is prevented by 
the replacement of His13 with Arg13 in the amyloid beta peptide. AlphaFold2 was 
used to predict the structure of the H. glaber amyloid beta peptide. HADDOCK and 
Hex were used to self-dock the peptides and dock ions on peptides, respectively. 
Illustrations were made by PyMol and ChimeraX. Using VMD, we calculated the 
radius of gyration. The phylogenetic analysis was conducted by Mega. The results 
showed an accurate structure with two alpha helices separated by a short coil 
for H. glaber. Self-docking of the two amyloid beta peptides demonstrated a 
globular conformation in the H. glaber dimer, implying the unlikeliness of 
amyloid beta peptides' self-aggregation to form fibrillar structures. This 
conformational state resulted in lower electrostatic energy compared to H. 
sapiens, contributing to H. glaber's lower tendency for fibril and, ultimately, 
plaque formation. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that amyloid precursor protein 
is highly conserved in each taxon of rodentia and primata. This study provides 
insight into the connection between the structure of H. glaber amyloid beta and 
its plaque formation properties, showing that the Arg13 in H. glaber leads to 
fibril instability, and might prevent senile plaque accumulation.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder accompanied by a 
reduction in cognition and memory. Till now, there is no definite cure for AD, 
although, there are treatments available that may improve some symptoms. 
Currently, in regenerative medicine stem cells are widely used, mainly for 
treating neurodegenerative diseases. There are numerous forms of stem cells to 
treat AD aiming at the expansion of the treatment methods for this particular 
disease. Since 10 years ago, science has gained abundant knowledge to treat AD 
by understanding the sorts of stem cells, methods, and phasing of injection. 
Besides, due to the side effects of stem cell therapy like the potentiation for 
cancer, and as it is hard to follow the cells through the matrix of the brain, 
researchers have presented a new therapy for AD. They prefer to use conditioned 
media (CM) that are full of different growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, 
enzymes, etc. without tumorigenicity or immunogenicity such as stem cells. 
Another benefit of CM is that CM could be kept in the freezer, easily packaged, 
and transported, and doesn't need to fit with the donor. Due to the beneficial 
effects of CM, in this paper, we intend to evaluate the effects of various types 
of CM of stem cells on AD.

BACKGROUND: The risk of incident dementia after surgery in older adults is 
unclear. The study objective was to examine the rate of incident dementia among 
older adults after elective surgery compared with a matched nonsurgical control 
group.
METHODS: We conducted a population-based, propensity-matched retrospective 
cohort study using data from linked administrative databases in Ontario, Canada. 
All community-dwelling individuals aged 66 years and older who underwent one of 
five major elective surgeries between April 1, 2007 and March 31, 2011 were 
included. Each surgical patient was matched 1:1 on surgical specialty of the 
surgeon at consultation, age, sex, fiscal year of entry, and propensity score 
with a patient who attended an outpatient visit with a surgeon of the same 
surgical specialty but did not undergo surgery. Patients were followed for up to 
5 years after cohort entry for the occurrence of a new dementia diagnosis, 
defined from administrative data. Cause-specific hazard models were used to 
estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the 
association between surgery and the hazard of incident dementia. Subgroup and 
sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: A total of 27,878 individuals (13,939 matched pairs) were included in 
the analysis. A total of 640 (4.6%) individuals in the surgical group and 965 
(6.9%) individuals in the control group developed dementia over the 5-year 
follow-up period. Individuals who underwent surgery had a reduced rate of 
incident dementia compared with their matched nonsurgical controls (HR 0.88; 95% 
CI 0.80-0.97; p = 0.01). This association was persistent in most subgroups and 
after sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Elective surgery did not increase the rate of incident dementia 
when compared with matched nonsurgical controls. This could be an important 
consideration for patients and surgeons when elective surgery is considered.

Lipids are the major component of the brain with important structural and 
functional properties. Lipid disruption could play a relevant role in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Some brain lipidomic studies showed significant 
differences compared to controls, but few studies have focused on different 
brain areas related to AD. Furthermore, AD is more prevalent in females, but 
there is a lack of studies focusing on this sex. This work aims to perform a 
lipidomic study in selected brain areas (cerebellum, amygdala, hippocampus, 
entire cortex) from wild-type (WT, n = 10) and APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic (TG, 
n = 10) female mice of 5 months of age, as a model of early AD, to identify 
alterations in lipid composition. A lipidomic mass spectrometry-based method was 
optimized and applied to brain tissue. As result, some lipids showed 
statistically significant differences between mice groups in cerebellum 
(n = 68), amygdala (n = 49), hippocampus (n = 48), and the cortex (n = 22). In 
addition, some lipids (n = 15) from the glycerolipid, phospholipid, and 
sphingolipid families were statistically significant in several brain areas 
simultaneously between WT and TG. A selection of lipid variables was made to 
develop a multivariate approach to assess their discriminant potential, showing 
high diagnostic indexes, especially in cerebellum and amygdala (sensitivity 
70-100%, sensibility 80-100%).

Anethole is a phenolic compound synthesized by many aromatic plants. Anethole is 
a substance that humans can safely consume and has been studied for years as a 
biologically active molecule to treat a variety of conditions, including nerve 
damage, gastritis, inflammation, and nociception. Anethole is thought to carry 
out its biological activities through direct interaction with ion channels. 
Anethole is beneficial for neurodegenerative Alzheimer's and Parkinson's 
diseases. Nevertheless, nothing has been investigated regarding the effects of 
anethole on voltage-gated Na+ channels (VGSCs), which are major players in 
neuronal function. We used cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons from neonatal 
rats as a source of natively expressed VGSCs for electrophysiological studies 
using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Our data show that anethole 
interacts directly with VGSCs. Anethole quickly blocks and unblocks (when 
removed) voltage-activated Na+ currents in this preparation in a fully 
reversible manner. Anethole's binding affinity to these channels increases when 
the inactive states of these channels are populated, similar to lidocaine's 
effect on the same channels. Our data show that anethole inhibits neuronal 
activity by blocking VGSCs in a state-dependent manner. These findings relate to 
the putative anesthetic activity attributable to anethole, in addition to its 
potential benefit in neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that excitatory repetitive 
transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can improve the cognitive function of 
patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Intermittent theta burst stimulation 
(iTBS) is a novel excitatory rTMS protocol for brain activity stimulation with 
the ability to induce long-term potentiation-like plasticity and represents a 
promising treatment for AD. However, the long-term effects of iTBS on cognitive 
decline and brain structure in patients with AD are unknown.
AIMS: We aimed to explore whether repeating accelerated iTBS every three months 
could slow down the cognitive decline in patients with AD.
METHODS: In this randomised, assessor-blinded, controlled trial, iTBS was 
administered to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of 42 patients 
with AD for 14 days every 13 weeks. Measurements included the Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment (MoCA), a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, and the grey 
matter volume (GMV) of the hippocampus. Patients were evaluated at baseline and 
after follow-up. The longitudinal pipeline of the Computational Anatomy Toolbox 
for SPM was used to detect significant treatment-related changes over time.
RESULTS: The iTBS group maintained MoCA scores relative to the control group 
(t=3.26, p=0.013) and reduced hippocampal atrophy, which was significantly 
correlated with global degeneration scale changes. The baseline Mini-Mental 
State Examination (MMSE) score, apolipoprotein E genotype and Clinical Dementia 
Rating were indicative of MoCA scores at follow-up. Moreover, the GMV of the 
left (t=0.08, p=0.996) and right (t=0.19, p=0.977) hippocampus were maintained 
in the active group but significantly declined in the control group (left: 
t=4.13, p<0.001; right: t=5.31, p<0.001). GMV change in the left (r=0.35, 
p=0.023) and right (r=0.36, p=0.021) hippocampus across the intervention 
positively correlated with MoCA changes; left hippocampal GMV change was 
negatively correlated with global degeneration scale (r=-0.32, p=0.041) changes.
CONCLUSIONS: DLPFC-iTBS may be a feasible and easy-to-implement 
non-pharmacological intervention to slow down the progressive decline of overall 
cognition and quality of life in patients with AD, providing a new AD treatment 
option.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to understand whether older adults' longitudinal 
completion of assessments in an online Alzheimer's disease and related dementias 
(ADRD)-related registry is influenced by self-reported medical conditions.
METHODS: Brain Health Registry (BHR) is an online cognitive aging and 
ADRD-related research registry that includes longitudinal health and cognitive 
assessments. Using logistic regressions, we examined associations between 
longitudinal registry completion outcomes and self-reported (1) number of 
medical conditions and (2) eight defined medical condition groups 
(cardiovascular, metabolic, immune system, ADRD, current psychiatric, substance 
use/abuse, acquired, other specified conditions) in adults aged 55+ (N = 
23,888). Longitudinal registry completion outcomes were assessed by the 
completion of the BHR initial questionnaire (first questionnaire participants 
see at each visit) at least twice and completion of a cognitive assessment 
(Cogstate Brief Battery) at least twice. Models included ethnocultural identity, 
education, age, and subjective memory concern as covariates.
RESULTS: We found that the likelihood of longitudinally completing the initial 
questionnaire was negatively associated with reporting a diagnosis of ADRD and 
current psychiatric conditions but was positively associated with reporting 
substance use/abuse and acquired medical conditions. The likelihood of 
longitudinally completing the cognitive assessment task was negatively 
associated with number of reported medical conditions, as well as with reporting 
cardiovascular conditions, ADRD, and current psychiatric conditions. Previously 
identified associations between ethnocultural identity and longitudinal 
assessment completion in BHR remained after accounting for the presence of 
medical conditions.
DISCUSSION: This post hoc analysis provides novel, initial evidence that older 
adults' completion of longitudinal assessments in an online registry is 
associated with the number and types of participant-reported medical conditions. 
Our findings can inform future efforts to make online studies with longitudinal 
health and cognitive assessments more usable for older adults with medical 
conditions. The results need to be interpreted with caution due to selection 
biases, and the under-inclusion of minoritized communities.

Cetaceans are well-regarded as sentinels for toxin exposure. Emerging studies 
suggest that cetaceans can also develop neuropathological changes associated 
with neurodegenerative disease. The occurrence of neuropathology makes cetaceans 
an ideal species for examining the impact of marine toxins on the brain across 
the lifespan. Here, we describe TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) 
proteinopathy and Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathological changes in a 
beached harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) that was exposed to a toxin produced 
by cyanobacteria called β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA). We found pathogenic 
TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions in neurons throughout the cerebral cortex, 
midbrain and brainstem. P62/sequestosome-1, responsible for the autophagy of 
misfolded proteins, was observed in the amygdala, hippocampus and frontal 
cortex. Genes implicated in AD and TDP-43 neuropathology such as APP and TARDBP 
were expressed in the brain. AD neuropathological changes such as amyloid-β 
plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, granulovacuolar degeneration and Hirano bodies 
were present in the hippocampus. These findings further support the development 
of progressive neurodegenerative disease in cetaceans and a potential causative 
link to cyanobacterial toxins. Climate change, nutrient pollution and industrial 
waste are increasing the frequency of harmful cyanobacterial blooms. Cyanotoxins 
like BMAA that are associated with neurodegenerative disease pose an increasing 
public health risk.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently an incurable neurodegenerative disorder 
and is the most common etiological cause of dementia. Consequently, it has 
severe burden on its patients and on their caregivers and represents a global 
health concern. Clinical investigations have indicated that a dysregulation of 
peripheral T cell immune homeostasis may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD, 
as well as in the early stages of AD, characterized by mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI). However, the characteristics and concomitant feasibility of the use of 
T-cell receptor (TCR) typing for disease diagnosis remains largely unknown. We 
employed a high-throughput sequencing and multidimensional bioinformatics 
analyses for the identification of TCR repertoires present in peripheral blood 
samples of 10 patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI), 10 patients with AD, and 10 
healthy controls (HCs). Based on the characteristics of the TCR repertoires in 
the amount and diversity of combinations of V-J, the spectrum of immune defense, 
and differentially expressed genes (DEGs), single and specific TCR profiles were 
observed in the patient samples of aMCI and AD compared to profiles of HCs. In 
particular, the diversity of TCR clonotypes manifested a pattern of "decreased 
first and then increased" pattern during the progression from aMCI to AD, a 
pattern that was not observed in HC samples. Additionally, a total of 46 and 35 
amino acid CDR3 sequences with consistent and reverse expressive abundance with 
diversity of TCR clonotypes were identified, respectively. Taken together, we 
provide novel and essential preliminary evidence demonstrating the presence of 
diversity of T cell repertoires from differentially expressed V-J gene segments 
and amino acid clonotypes using peripheral blood samples from patients with AD, 
aMCI, and from HC. Such findings have the potential to reveal potential 
mechanisms through which aMCI progresses to AD and provide a reference for the 
future development of immune-related diagnoses and therapies for AD.

Homozygosity for the ε4 allele of APOE increases the odds of developing 
Alzheimer's by 12 to 15 times relative to the most common ε3;ε3 genotype, and 
its association with higher plaque loads comports with evidence that APOEε4 
compromises autophagy. The ApoE4 protein specifically binds a cis element 
("CLEAR") in the promoters of several autophagy genes to block their 
transcription. We used a multifaceted approach to identify a druggable site in 
ApoE4, and virtual screening of lead-like compounds identified small molecules 
that specifically bind to this site to impede ApoE4::DNA binding. We validated 
these molecules both in vitro and in vivo with models expressing ApoE4, 
including ApoE4 targeted-replacement mice. One compound was able to 
significantly restore transcription of several autophagy genes and protected 
against amyloid-like aggregation in a C. elegans AD model. Together, these 
findings provide proof-of-principle evidence for pharmacological remediation of 
lysosomal autophagy by ApoE4 via ApoE4-targeted lead molecules that represent a 
novel tack on neurodegenerative disorders.

OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have shown possible choroid plexus (CP) dysfunction 
in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and highlighted CP enlargement on magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) as a predictive factor of AD. However, few studies have assessed 
the relationship between CP volume (CPV) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In 
this large elderly population study, we investigated the changes in CPV in 
patients with MCI using MRI above 65 years.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 2144 participants (median age, 69 
years; 60.9% females) who underwent 3T MRI; they were grouped as 218 MCI 
participants and 1904 cognitively healthy controls. The total intracranial 
volume (ICV), total brain volume (TBV), CPV, hippocampal volume (HV), and 
lateral ventricle volume (LVV) were calculated.
RESULTS: CPV/ICV was a significant independent predictor of MCI (p < 0.01) after 
adjusting for potential confounders (age, sex, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, 
diabetes, and education level). The CPV/ICV ratio was also a significant 
independent predictor of MCI after adjusting for the TBV/ICV ratio (p = 0.022) 
or HV/ICV ratio (p = 0.017), in addition to potential confounders. The CPV was 
significantly correlated with the LVV (r = 0.97, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: We identified a relationship between CPV and MCI, which could not be 
explained by the degree of brain atrophy. Our results support CP dysfunction in 
MCI.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Choroid plexus volume measurement may serve as a 
valuable imaging biomarker for diagnosing and monitoring mild cognitive 
impairment. The enlargement of the choroid plexus, independent of brain atrophy, 
suggests its potential role in mild cognitive impairment pathology.
KEY POINTS: • The study examines choroid plexus volume in relation to cognitive 
decline in elderly. • Enlarged choroid plexus volume independently indicates 
mild cognitive impairment presence. • Choroid plexus volume could be a specific 
biomarker for early mild cognitive impairment diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Psychosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with worse 
outcomes, yet no established biomarkers exist for early diagnosis and 
intervention. We compared tau PET burden across older individuals with and 
without psychotic symptoms.
METHODS: [18F]AV1451 tau PET binding was compared between 26 Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) subjects with psychotic symptoms (delusions 
and/or hallucinations) and 26 ADNI subjects without psychotic symptoms, matched 
for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and clinical severity. Tau was assessed on a 
region-of-interest and voxel level, corrected for amyloid PET burden.
RESULTS: Tau was greater in individuals with psychotic symptoms in the amygdala 
in region-of-interest analyses, and in amygdala, thalamus, putamen, right 
hippocampus, right entorhinal cortex, and right frontal cortex in voxel-based 
analyses. When considering different onset and type of psychotic symptoms, tau 
binding was greatest in those with concurrent delusions.
CONCLUSION: Elevated tau in limbic regions may be relevant for psychotic 
symptoms in aging and AD.

Resveratrol, a naturally occurring polyphenol that activates sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), 
has been shown to reduce overall levels of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with Alzheimer's dementia (AD). 
Depending on the site of release, however, MMP-9 has the potential to improve or 
impair cognition. In particular, its release from microglia or pericytes 
proximal to the blood brain barrier can damage the basement membrane, while 
neuronal activity-dependent release of this protease from glutamatergic neurons 
can instead promote dendritic spine expansion and long-term potentiation of 
synaptic plasticity. In the present study, we test the hypothesis that 
resveratrol reduces overall MMP-9 levels in CSF samples from patients with 
APOE4, an allele associated with increased glial inflammation. We also examine 
the possibility that resveratrol reduces inflammation-associated MMP release 
from cultured glia but spares neuronal activity-dependent release from cultured 
cortical neurons. We observe that resveratrol decreases overall levels of MMP-2 
and MMP-9 in CSF samples from AD patients. Resveratrol also reduces CSF levels 
of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1), glial-derived protein that 
restricts long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission, in individuals 
homozygous for APOE4. Consistent with these results, we observe that resveratrol 
reduces basal and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated MMP and TIMP-1 release 
from cultured microglia and astrocytes. In contrast, however, resveratrol does 
not inhibit release of MMP-9 from cortical neurons. Overall, these results are 
consistent with the possibility that while resveratrol reduces potentially 
maladaptive MMP and TIMP-1 release from activated glia, 
neuroplasticity-promoting MMP release from neurons is spared. In contrast, 
resveratrol reduces release of neurocan and brevican, extracellular matrix 
components that restrict neuroplasticity, from both neurons and glia. These data 
underscore the diversity of resveratrol's actions with respect to affected cell 
types and molecular targets and also suggest that further studies may be 
warranted to determine if its effects on glial MMP release could make it a 
useful adjunct for AD- and/or anti-amyloid therapy-related damage to the blood 
brain barrier.

BACKGROUND: Obesity is a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
However, its relation with tau pathology (i.e., aberrant tau protein behavior in 
tauopathies such as AD) has been inconclusive.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the interaction between a high-fat diet (HFD) 
and tau pathology in adult male mice.
METHODS: Transgenic mice overexpressing human P301S Tau (those with the 
pathology) and wild-type (WT) littermates were subjected to behavioral tests, 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), 
and western blotting analysis to investigate the effects of prolonged HFD versus 
regular diet during adulthood.
RESULTS: HFD increased body weight in both WT and P301S mice but had minimal 
effect on blood glucose levels. The brain response to HFD was tau 
genotype-specific. WT mice exhibited decreased recognition memory and enhanced 
network connectivity in fMRI, while P301S mice exhibited white matter tract 
disorganization in DTI as the sole significant finding. The reduction of insulin 
receptor β, insulin downstream signaling, neuronal nuclear protein, 
CD68-positive phagocytic activity, and myelin basic protein level were confined 
to the cortex of WT mice. In contrast to P301S mice, WT mice showed significant 
changes in the tau protein and its phosphorylation levels along with increased 
soluble neurofilament light levels in the hippocampus.
CONCLUSIONS: HFD-induced brain dysfunction and pathological changes were blunted 
in mice with the pathology and more profound in healthy mice. Our findings 
highlight the need to consider this interaction between obesity and tau 
pathology when tailoring treatment strategies for AD and other tauopathies.

BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence is demonstrating that degeneration of specific 
thalamic nuclei, in addition to the hippocampus, may occur in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) from the prodromal stage (mild cognitive impairment - MCI) and 
contribute to memory impairment.
OBJECTIVE: Here, we evaluated the presence of macro and micro structural 
alterations at the level of the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) and medio-dorsal 
thalamic nuclei (MDTN) in AD and amnestic MCI (aMCI) and the possible 
relationship between such changes and the severity of memory impairment.
METHODS: For this purpose, a sample of 50 patients with aMCI, 50 with AD, and 50 
age- and education-matched healthy controls (HC) were submitted to a 3-T MRI 
protocol with whole-brain T1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging and a 
comprehensive neuropsychological assessment.
RESULTS: At macro-structural level, both the ATN and MDTN were found 
significantly smaller in patients with aMCI and AD when compared to HC subjects. 
At micro-structural level, instead, diffusion alterations that significantly 
differentiated aMCI and AD patients from HC subjects were found only in the ATN, 
but not in the MDTN. Moreover, diffusion values of the ATN were significantly 
associated with poor episodic memory in the overall patients' group.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings represent the first in vivo evidence of a relevant 
involvement of ATN in the AD-related neurodegeneration and memory profile and 
strengthen the importance to look beyond the hippocampus when considering 
neurological conditions characterized by memory decline.

Clinically-Inspired Multi-Agent Transformers for Disease Trajectory Forecasting 
From Multimodal Data.

Nguyen HH, Blaschko MB, Saarakkala S, Tiulpin A.

Deep neural networks are often applied to medical images to automate the problem 
of medical diagnosis. However, a more clinically relevant question that 
practitioners usually face is how to predict the future trajectory of a disease. 
Current methods for prognosis or disease trajectory forecasting often require 
domain knowledge and are complicated to apply. In this paper, we formulate the 
prognosis prediction problem as a one-to-many prediction problem. Inspired by a 
clinical decision-making process with two agents-a radiologist and a general 
practitioner - we predict prognosis with two transformer-based components that 
share information with each other. The first transformer in this framework aims 
to analyze the imaging data, and the second one leverages its internal states as 
inputs, also fusing them with auxiliary clinical data. The temporal nature of 
the problem is modeled within the transformer states, allowing us to treat the 
forecasting problem as a multi-task classification, for which we propose a novel 
loss. We show the effectiveness of our approach in predicting the development of 
structural knee osteoarthritis changes and forecasting Alzheimer's disease 
clinical status directly from raw multi-modal data. The proposed method 
outperforms multiple state-of-the-art baselines with respect to performance and 
calibration, both of which are needed for real-world applications. An 
open-source implementation of our method is made publicly available at 
https://github.com/Oulu-IMEDS/CLIMATv2.

BACKGROUND: Specific peripheral proteins have been implicated to play an 
important role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the 
roles of additional novel protein biomarkers in AD etiology remains elusive. The 
availability of large-scale AD GWAS and plasma proteomic data provide the 
resources needed for the identification of causally relevant circulating 
proteins that may serve as risk factors for AD and potential therapeutic 
targets.
METHODS: We established and validated genetic prediction models for protein 
levels in plasma as instruments to investigate the associations between 
genetically predicted protein levels and AD risk. We studied 71,880 (proxy) 
cases and 383,378 (proxy) controls of European descent.
RESULTS: We identified 69 proteins with genetically predicted concentrations 
showing associations with AD risk. The drugs almitrine and ciclopirox targeting 
ATP1A1 were suggested to have a potential for being repositioned for AD 
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides additional insights into the underlying 
mechanisms of AD and potential therapeutic strategies.

Cholesterol regulates fluidity and structure of cellular membranes. The brain is 
involved in signal transduction, synaptogenesis, and membrane trafficking. An 
impairment of its metabolism was observed in different neurodegenerative 
diseases, such as Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer, and Huntington diseases. 
Because of the blood-brain barrier, cholesterol cannot be uptaken from the 
circulation and all the cholesterol is locally synthetized. The excess 
cholesterol in neurons is converted into 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24OHC) by the 
cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1). The plasmatic concentration of 24OHC 
results in the balance between cerebral production and liver elimination. It is 
related to the number of metabolically active neurons in the brain. Several 
factors that affect the brain cholesterol turnover and the liver elimination of 
oxysterols, the genetic background, nutrition, and lifestyle habits were found 
to significantly affect plasma levels of 24OHC. Reduced levels of 24OHC were 
found related to the loss of metabolically active cells and the degree of brain 
atrophy. The dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier, inflammation, and increased 
cholesterol turnover might overlap with this progressive reduction giving 
temporary increased levels of 24OHC.The study of plasma 24OHC is likely to offer 
an insight into brain cholesterol turnover with a limited diagnostic power.

Update of
    bioRxiv. 2023 Oct 11;:

The greatest known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is age. While both 
normal aging and AD pathology involve structural changes in the brain, their 
trajectories of atrophy are not the same. Recent developments in artificial 
intelligence have encouraged studies to leverage neuroimaging-derived measures 
and deep learning approaches to predict brain age, which has shown promise as a 
sensitive biomarker in diagnosing and monitoring AD. However, prior efforts 
primarily involved structural magnetic resonance imaging and conventional 
diffusion MRI (dMRI) metrics without accounting for partial volume effects. To 
address this issue, we post-processed our dMRI scans with an advanced free-water 
(FW) correction technique to compute distinct FW-corrected fractional anisotropy 
(FAFWcorr) and FW maps that allow for the separation of tissue from fluid in a 
scan. We built 3 densely connected neural networks from FW-corrected dMRI, 
T1-weighted MRI, and combined FW+T1 features, respectively, to predict brain 
age. We then investigated the relationship of actual age and predicted brain 
ages with cognition. We found that all models accurately predicted actual age in 
cognitively unimpaired (CU) controls (FW: r=0.66, p=1.62x10-32; T1: r=0.61, 
p=1.45x10-26, FW+T1: r=0.77, p=6.48x10-50) and distinguished between CU and mild 
cognitive impairment participants (FW: p=0.006; T1: p=0.048; FW+T1: p=0.003), 
with FW+T1-derived age showing best performance. Additionally, all predicted 
brain age models were significantly associated with cross-sectional cognition 
(memory, FW: β=-1.094, p=6.32x10-7; T1: β=-1.331, p=6.52x10-7; FW+T1: β=-1.476, 
p=2.53x10-10; executive function, FW: β=-1.276, p=1.46x10-9; T1: β=-1.337, 
p=2.52x10-7; FW+T1: β=-1.850, p=3.85x10-17) and longitudinal cognition (memory, 
FW: β=-0.091, p=4.62x10-11; T1: β=-0.097, p=1.40x10-8; FW+T1: β=-0.101, 
p=1.35x10-11; executive function, FW: β=-0.125, p=1.20x10-10; T1: β=-0.163, 
p=4.25x10-12; FW+T1: β=-0.158, p=1.65x10-14). Our findings provide evidence that 
both T1-weighted MRI and dMRI measures improve brain age prediction and support 
predicted brain age as a sensitive biomarker of cognition and cognitive decline.

Rare genetic variation in Fibronectin 1 ( FN1 ) protects against APOEe4 in 
Alzheimer's disease.

The risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) significantly increases in 
individuals carrying the APOEε4 allele. Elderly cognitively healthy individuals 
with APOEε4 also exist, suggesting the presence of cellular mechanisms that 
counteract the pathological effects of APOEε4 ; however, these mechanisms are 
unknown. We hypothesized that APOEε4 carriers without dementia might carry 
genetic variations that could protect them from developing APOEε4- mediated AD 
pathology. To test this, we leveraged whole genome sequencing (WGS) data in 
National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Family Based Study (NIA-AD FBS), 
Washington Heights/Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP), and Estudio Familiar 
de Influencia Genetica en Alzheimer (EFIGA) cohorts and identified potentially 
protective variants segregating exclusively among unaffected APOEε4 carriers. In 
homozygous unaffected carriers above 70 years old, we identified 510 rare coding 
variants. Pathway analysis of the genes harboring these variants showed 
significant enrichment in extracellular matrix (ECM)-related processes, 
suggesting protective effects of functional modifications in ECM proteins. We 
prioritized two genes that were highly represented in the ECM-related gene 
ontology terms, (FN1) and collagen type VI alpha 2 chain ( COL6A2 ) and are 
known to be expressed at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), for postmortem 
validation and in vivo functional studies. The FN1 and COL6A2 protein levels 
were increased at the BBB in APOEε4 carriers with AD. Brain expression of 
cognitively unaffected homozygous APOEε4 carriers had significantly lower FN1 
deposition and less reactive gliosis compared to homozygous APOEε4 carriers with 
AD, suggesting that FN1 might be a downstream driver of APOEε4 -mediated 
AD-related pathology and cognitive decline. To validate our findings, we used 
zebrafish models with loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in fn1b - the ortholog 
for human FN1 . We found that fibronectin LOF reduced gliosis, enhanced 
gliovascular remodeling and potentiated the microglial response, suggesting that 
pathological accumulation of FN1 could impair toxic protein clearance, which is 
ameliorated with FN1 LOF. Our study suggests vascular deposition of FN1 is 
related to the pathogenicity of APOEε4 , LOF variants in FN1 may reduce APOEε4 
-related AD risk, providing novel clues to potential therapeutic interventions 
targeting the ECM to mitigate AD risk.

The tetracycline transactivator (tTA) system provides controllable transgene 
expression through oral administration of the broad-spectrum antibiotic 
doxycycline. Antibiotic treatment for transgene control in mouse models of 
disease might have undesirable systemic effects resulting from changes in the 
gut microbiome. Here we assessed the impact of doxycycline on gut microbiome 
diversity in a tTA-controlled model of Alzheimer's disease and then examined 
neuroimmune effects of these microbiome alterations following acute LPS 
challenge. We show that doxycycline decreased microbiome diversity in both 
transgenic and wild-type mice and that these changes persisted long after drug 
withdrawal. Despite the change in microbiome composition, doxycycline treatment 
had minimal effect on basal transcriptional signatures of inflammation the brain 
or on the neuroimmune response to LPS challenge. Our findings suggest that 
central neuroimmune responses may be less affected by doxycycline at doses 
needed for transgene control than by antibiotic cocktails at doses used for 
experimental microbiome disruption.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment (CI) is one of the major complications in 
chronic kidney disease patients, especially those with end-stage renal disease 
(ESRD). Limited biomarkers have been found that can significantly predict 
ESRD-associated cognitive decline.
OBJECTIVE: This cohort study aimed to investigate de novo biomarkers for 
diagnosis of the ESRD-associated CI.
METHODS: In this cohort study, qualified samples were divided into control (with 
an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of≥60 mL/min and a Mini-Mental 
State Examination (MMSE) score of > 27), ESRD without CI (eGFR < 15 and 
MMSE > 27), and ESRD with CI (eGFR < 15 and MMSE < 27) groups. Levels of plasma 
amyloid-β (Aβ)1 - 42, serum indoxyl sulfate, and hematologic and biochemical 
parameters were measured.
RESULTS: Compared to the control group, levels of blood urea nitrogen, 
creatinine, and indoxyl sulfate were elevated in ESRD patients both without and 
with CI. Interestingly, ESRD patients with CI had the lowest levels of serum 
albumin. In contrast, levels of plasma Aβ1 - 42 were significantly higher in the 
ESRD with CI group than in the control and ESRD without CI groups. In addition, 
the ratio of plasma Aβ1 - 42 over serum albumin was significantly higher in the 
ESRD with CI group than in the control or ESRD without CI groups. Importantly, 
the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for CI in the 
total population by the ratio of Aβ1 - 42 over albumin was 0.785 and significant 
(p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: This cohort study has shown that the ratio of plasma Aβ1 - 42 over 
serum albumin can be a de novo biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of 
ESRD-associated cognitive decline.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents the early stage of dementia including 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is a crucial stage for therapeutic interventions 
and treatment. Early detection of MCI offers opportunities for early 
intervention and significantly benefits cohort enrichment for clinical trials. 
Imaging and in vivo markers in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers have 
high detection performance, yet their prohibitive costs and intrusiveness demand 
more affordable and accessible alternatives. The recent advances in digital 
biomarkers, especially language markers, have shown great potential, where 
variables informative to MCI are derived from linguistic and/or speech and later 
used for predictive modeling. A major challenge in modeling language markers 
comes from the variability of how each person speaks. As the cohort size for 
language studies is usually small due to extensive data collection efforts, the 
variability among persons makes language markers hard to generalize to unseen 
subjects. In this paper, we propose a novel subject harmonization tool to 
address the issue of distributional differences in language markers across 
subjects, thus enhancing the generalization performance of machine learning 
models. Our empirical results show that machine learning models built on our 
harmonized features have improved prediction performance on unseen data. The 
source code and experiment scripts are available at

Aluminium (AL) is a strong environmental neurotoxin linked to neurodegenerative 
disorders. Widespread industrial use leads to its presence in water systems, 
causing bioaccumulation in organisms. This, in turn, results in the 
bioaccumulation of AL in various organisms. Several studies have highlighted the 
benefits of enhanced physical activity in combating neurodegenerative diseases. 
Meanwhile widespread presence of apigenin in aquatic environment has been 
largely overlooked, in terms of its potential to counter AL-induced 
neurotoxicity. The combined impact of exercise and apigenin in mitigating the 
effects of AL-induced neurotoxicity in aquatic animals remains unexplored. 
Hence, the objective of this study is to determine whether the combined 
treatment of exercise and apigenin can effectively alleviate the chronic 
neurotoxicity induced by AL. Zebrafish that were exposed to AL showed behaviours 
resembling anxiety, increased aggression, unusual swimming pattern, and memory 
impairment, which are typical features observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like 
syndrome. Combined treatment of exercise and apigenin protects zebrafish from 
AL-induced neurotoxicity, which was measured by improvements in memory, reduced 
anxiety and aggression, and increased levels of antioxidant enzymes and 
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. Furthermore, AL exposure is associated 
with increased expression of genes related to neuroinflammation and AD. However, 
synergistic effect of exercise and apigenin counteract this effect in AL-treated 
zebrafish. These findings suggest that AL is involved in neurodegenerative 
diseases in fish, which could affect the integrity of aquatic ecosystem. Hence, 
there is a strong correlation between enhanced physical activity, apigenin, and 
the well-being of the ecosystem.

Both plasma biomarkers and brain network topology have shown great potential in 
the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the specific 
associations between plasma AD biomarkers, structural network topology, and 
cognition across the AD continuum have yet to be fully elucidated. This 
retrospective study evaluated participants from the Sino Longitudinal Study of 
Cognitive Decline cohort between September 2009 and October 2022 with available 
blood samples or 3.0-T MRI brain scans. Plasma biomarker levels were measured 
using the Single Molecule Array platform, including β-amyloid (Aβ), 
phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and 
neurofilament light chain (NfL). The topological structure of brain white matter 
was assessed using network efficiency. Trend analyses were carried out to 
evaluate the alterations of the plasma markers and network efficiency with AD 
progression. Correlation and mediation analyses were conducted to further 
explore the relationships among plasma markers, network efficiency, and 
cognitive performance across the AD continuum. Among the plasma markers, GFAP 
emerged as the most sensitive marker (linear trend: t = 11.164, p = 3.59 × 10-24 
; quadratic trend: t = 7.708, p = 2.25 × 10-13 ; adjusted R2  = 0.475), followed 
by NfL (linear trend: t = 6.542, p = 2.9 × 10-10 ; quadratic trend: t = 3.896, 
p = 1.22 × 10-4 ; adjusted R2  = 0.330), p-tau181 (linear trend: t = 8.452, 
p = 1.61 × 10-15 ; quadratic trend: t = 6.316, p = 1.05 × 10-9 ; adjusted R2 
 = 0.346) and Aβ42/Aβ40 (linear trend: t = -3.257, p = 1.27 × 10-3 ; quadratic 
trend: t = -1.662, p = 9.76 × 10-2 ; adjusted R2  = 0.101). Local efficiency 
decreased in brain regions across the frontal and temporal cortex and striatum. 
The principal component of local efficiency within these regions was correlated 
with GFAP (Pearson's R = -0.61, p = 6.3 × 10-7 ), NfL (R = -0.57, p = 6.4 × 10-6 
), and p-tau181 (R = -0.48, p = 2.0 × 10-4 ). Moreover, network efficiency 
mediated the relationship between general cognition and GFAP (ab = -0.224, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] = [-0.417 to -0.029], p = .0196 for MMSE; ab = -0.198, 
95% CI = [-0.42 to -0.003], p = .0438 for MOCA) or NfL (ab = -0.224, 95% 
CI = [-0.417 to -0.029], p = .0196 for MMSE; ab = -0.198, 95% CI = [-0.42 to 
-0.003], p = .0438 for MOCA). Our findings suggest that network efficiency 
mediates the association between plasma biomarkers, specifically GFAP and NfL, 
and cognitive performance in the context of AD progression, thus highlighting 
the potential utility of network-plasma approaches for early detection, 
monitoring, and intervention strategies in the management of AD.

Plasmalogens are a family of glycerophospholipids containing one vinyl-ether 
bond at the sn-1 position in the glycerol backbone, and play important roles in 
cellular homeostasis including neural transmission. Therefore, reductions of 
plasmalogens have been associated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). To evaluate the potential protective effects of 
plasmalogens against the pathology of AD, protein expression levels of key 
factors in amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolic processes were examined 
using human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Here, 
phosphatidylcholine-plasmalogen-oleic acid (PC-PLS-18) was shown to reduce 
protein expression levels of β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), clusterin, 
and Tau, factors involved in the amyloid β-associated pathogenesis of AD. Thus, 
PC-PLS-18 may have preventive effects against AD by delaying the onset risk for 
a certain period.

Understanding the relationship between blood nutrients and neurodegeneration 
could contribute to devising strategies for preventing Alzheimer's disease. We 
investigated the associations between fatty acids, vitamins D, B6, B12, folate, 
homocysteine, and the cerebral load of amyloid β (Aβ). This cross-sectional 
study included 177 older adults (70-96 years, 65% female) with objective 
cognitive impairment, prefrail, or frail. Cerebral Aβ load was determined using 
positron emission tomography Standardized Uptake Value ratios. Fatty acids were 
assessed in erythrocytes, vitamins D and homocysteine in serum, and the other 
vitamins in plasma. Linear regression models corrected for multiple comparisons 
evaluated the associations between each nutrient and Aβ. The principal component 
factor followed by linear regression grouped the fatty acids strongly correlated 
(factor) and associated with Aβ. Higher concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty 
acids (PUFAs): clupanodonic acid (22:5n-3; β: -0.13; p = .001), mead acid 
(20:3n-9; β: -0.07; p = .036), and adrenic acid (22:4n-6; β: -0.05; p = .031) 
were associated with lower global Aβ load, whereas linoleic acid (18:2n-6) was 
associated with higher global Aβ load (β: 0.18; p = .042). Clupanodonic acid was 
inversely associated with Aβ in all cerebral regions except the thalamus. The 
factor composed of mead, clupanodonic, and arachidonic (20:4n-6) acids was 
associated with a lower global Aβ load (β: -0.02; p = .002). Some erythrocyte 
PUFAs were inversely associated with Aβ load in the brain, and most of them were 
metabolites of the essential fatty acids linoleic and α-linolenic. Given the 
cross-sectional design, these results must be carefully interpreted, and 
longitudinal studies are needed.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a complex challenge characterized by cognitive 
decline and memory loss. Genetic variations have emerged as crucial players in 
the etiology of AD, enabling hope for a better understanding of the disease 
mechanisms; yet the specific mechanism of action for those genetic variants 
remain uncertain. Animal models with reminiscent disease pathology could uncover 
previously uncharacterized roles of these genes. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, 
we generated a knockout model for abca7, orthologous to human ABCA7 - an 
established AD-risk gene. The abca7 +/- zebrafish showed reduced astroglial 
proliferation, synaptic density, and microglial abundance in response to amyloid 
beta 42 (Aβ42). Single-cell transcriptomics revealed abca7 -dependent neuronal 
and glial cellular crosstalk through neuropeptide Y (NPY) signaling. The abca7 
knockout reduced the expression of npy, bdnf and ngfra , which are required for 
synaptic integrity and astroglial proliferation. With clinical data in humans, 
we showed reduced NPY in AD correlates with elevated Braak stage, predicted 
regulatory interaction between NPY and BDNF , identified genetic variants in NPY 
associated with AD, found segregation of variants in ABCA7, BDNF and NGFR in AD 
families, and discovered epigenetic changes in the promoter regions of NPY, NGFR 
and BDNF in humans with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms in ABCA7 . 
These results suggest that ABCA7-dependent NPY signaling is required for 
synaptic integrity, the impairment of which generates a risk factor for AD 
through compromised brain resilience.

PURPOSE: Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) play a 
crucial role in non-image-forming visual functions. Given their significant loss 
observed in various ocular degenerative diseases at early stages, this study 
aimed to assess changes in both the morphology and associated behavioral 
functions of ipRGCs in mice between 6 (mature) and 12 (late adult) months old. 
The findings contribute to understanding the preservation of ipRGCs in late 
adults and their potential as a biomarker for early ocular degenerative 
diseases.
METHODS: Female and male C57BL/6J mice were used to assess the behavioral 
consequences of aging to mature and old adults, including pupillary light 
reflex, light aversion, visual acuity, and contrast sensitivity. 
Immunohistochemistry on retinal wholemounts from these mice was then conducted 
to evaluate ipRGC dendritic morphology in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and 
inner nuclear layer (INL).
RESULTS: Morphological analysis showed that ipRGC dendritic field complexity was 
remarkably stable through 12 months old of age. Similarly, the pupillary light 
reflex, visual acuity, and contrast sensitivity were stable in mature and old 
adults. Although alterations were observed in ipRGC-independent light aversion 
distinct from the pupillary light reflex, aged wild-type mice continuously 
showed enhanced light aversion with dilation. No effect of sex was observed in 
any tests.
CONCLUSIONS: The preservation of both ipRGC morphology and function highlights 
the potential of ipRGC-mediated function as a valuable biomarker for ocular 
diseases characterized by early ipRGC loss. The consistent stability of ipRGCs 
in mature and old adult mice suggests that detected changes in ipRGC-mediated 
functions could serve as early indicators or diagnostic tools for early-onset 
conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and diabetes, where 
ipRGC loss has been documented.

BACKGROUND: Depression is a risk factor for dementia and weight change can 
appear as a symptom of depression. However, the association between weight 
change after the diagnosis of depression and the risk of dementia is poorly 
established. This study aimed to investigate the association between weight 
change before and after a diagnosis of depression with the subsequent risk of 
dementia.
METHODS: The National Health Insurance Sharing Service database was used. 1 308 
730 patients aged ⩾40 years diagnosed with depression were identified to be 
eligible. Weight changes after their depression diagnosis were categorized and 
subsequent incidence of dementia was followed up.
RESULTS: During an average follow-up period of 5.2 years (s.d., 2.0 years), 69 
373 subjects were newly diagnosed with all-cause dementia (56 351 were 
Alzheimer's disease and 6877 were vascular dementia). Regarding all outcomes, 
compared to those with a minimal weight change (-5 to 5%), all groups with 
weight gain or loss showed increased risks of dementia after adjusting potential 
risk factors for dementia, in all analysis models with a dose-response 
relationship, showing a U-shaped association.
CONCLUSIONS: Weight change as a symptom of depression could be a predictor for 
the future development of dementia.

Extracellular elastin-derived peptides (EDPs) accumulate in the aging brain and 
have been associated with vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The 
activation of inflammatory processes in glial cells with EDP treatment has 
received attention, but not in neurons. To properly understand EDPs' pathogenic 
significance, the impact on neuronal function and neuron-microglia crosstalk was 
explored further. Among the EDP molecules, Val-Gly-Val-Ala-Pro-Gly (VGVAPG) is a 
typical repeating hexapeptide. Here, we observed that EDPs-VGVAPG influenced 
neuronal survival and morphology in a dose-dependent manner. High concentrations 
of VGVAPG induced synapse loss and microglia hyperactivation in vivo and 
in vitro. Following EDP incubation, galectin 3 (Gal-3) released by neurons 
served as a chemokine, attracting microglial engulfment. Blocking Gal-3 and EDP 
binding remedied synapse loss in neurons and phagocytosis in microglia. In 
response to the accumulation of EDPs, proteomics in matrix remodeling and 
cytoskeleton dynamics, such as a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) 
family, were engaged. These findings in extracellular EDPs provided more 
evidence for the relationship between aging and neuron dysfunction, increasing 
the insight of neuroinflammatory responses and the development of new 
specialized extracellular matrix remolding-targeted therapy options for dementia 
or other neurodegenerative disease.

BACKGROUND: Hospitalization in individuals with dementia can be associated with 
negative and unintended outcomes. Research indicates that people with dementia 
experience more hospital admissions in comparison to individuals without 
dementia. This study aims to assess the survival time of individuals with 
dementia who experience unplanned hospitalization and examine the factors that 
are associated with mortality in this population.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from older 
adults with dementia who survived unplanned hospitalizations at Maharaj Nakorn 
Chiang Mai Hospital between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2016. The 
association between factors and mortality were analyzed using a multivariable 
Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-one cases were included. The mean age of the 
study population was 80.07 (SD 7.49) years, and the majority were female 
(56.91%). The median survival time of the studied cohort was 3.06 years (95% CI 
3.14-3.60). The multivariable analysis revealed that older age (aHR = 1.02, 95% 
CI 1.00-1.05), a diagnosis of mixed-type dementia (aHR = 3.45, 95% CI 
1.17-10.14), higher Charlson comorbidity index score (aHR = 1.19, 95% CI 
1.04-1.36), higher serum creatinine level (aHR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.10-1.66), 
insertion of endotracheal tube (aHR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.07-3.54), and readmission 
within 30 days (aHR = 1.88, 95% CI 1.18-2.98) were associated with an increased 
risk of mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified several notable predictors of mortality. Healthcare 
providers can use the findings of this study to identify patients who may be at 
higher risk of mortality and develop targeted interventions which may improve 
patient outcomes.

Deviations of brain age from chronologic age, known as the brain age gap (BAG), 
have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD). 
Here, we compare the associations of MRI-derived (atrophy) or 18F-FDG 
PET-derived (brain metabolism) BAG with cognitive performance, neuropathologic 
burden, and disease progression in cognitively normal individuals (CNs) and 
individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) or mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI). Methods: Machine learning pipelines were trained to estimate brain age 
from 185 matched T1-weighted MRI or 18F-FDG PET scans of CN from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and validated in external test sets from the 
Open Access of Imaging and German Center for Neurodegenerative 
Diseases-Longitudinal Cognitive Impairment and Dementia studies. BAG was 
correlated with measures of cognitive performance and AD neuropathology in CNs, 
SCD subjects, and MCI subjects. Finally, BAG was compared between cognitively 
stable and declining individuals and subsequently used to predict disease 
progression. Results: MRI (mean absolute error, 2.49 y) and 18F-FDG PET (mean 
absolute error, 2.60 y) both estimated chronologic age well. At the SCD stage, 
MRI-based BAG correlated significantly with beta-amyloid1-42 (Aβ1-42) in 
cerebrospinal fluid, whereas 18F-FDG PET BAG correlated with memory performance. 
At the MCI stage, both BAGs were associated with memory and executive function 
performance and cerebrospinal fluid Aβ1-42, but only MRI-derived BAG correlated 
with phosphorylated-tau181/Aβ1-42 Lastly, MRI-estimated BAG predicted MCI-to-AD 
progression better than 18F-FDG PET-estimated BAG (areas under the curve, 0.73 
and 0.60, respectively). Conclusion: Age was reliably estimated from MRI or 
18F-FDG PET. MRI BAG reflected cognitive and pathologic markers of AD in SCD and 
MCI, whereas 18F-FDG PET BAG was sensitive mainly to early cognitive impairment, 
possibly constituting an independent biomarker of brain age-related changes.

Although the COVID-19 pandemic has officially ended, the persistent challenge of 
long-COVID or post-acute COVID sequelae (PASC) continues to impact societies 
globally, highlighting the urgent need for ongoing research into its mechanisms 
and therapeutic approaches. Our team has recently developed a novel humanized 
ACE2 mouse model (hACE2ki) designed explicitly for long-COVID/PASC research. 
This model exhibits human ACE2 expression in tissue and cell-specific patterns 
akin to mouse Ace2. When we exposed young adult hACE2ki mice (6 weeks old) to 
various SARS-CoV-2 lineages, including WA, Delta, and Omicron, at a dose of 
5 × 105 PFU/mouse via nasal instillation, the mice demonstrated distinctive 
phenotypes characterized by differences in viral load in the lung, trachea, and 
nasal turbinate, weight loss, and changes in pro-inflammatory cytokines and 
immune cell profiles in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Notably, no mortality was 
observed in this age group. Further, to assess the model's relevance for 
long-COVID studies, we investigated tau protein pathologies, which are linked to 
Alzheimer's disease, in the brains of these mice post SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our 
findings revealed the accumulation and longitudinal propagation of tau, 
confirming the potential of our hACE2ki mouse model for preclinical studies of 
long-COVID.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder affecting the 
central nervous system. Current drugs for AD have limited effectiveness and 
often come with side effects. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop 
new, safe, and more effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease. In this work, 
two novel benzil-hydrazone compounds, abbreviated 2-ClMHB and 2-ClBHB, were 
synthesized for the first time by refluxing the benzil with 2-Chloro phenyl 
hydrazine and they have been tested for their in vitro anti-cholinesterase 
activities and in silico acetyl and butyryl enzymes inhibition. The resulting 
products were characterized using UV-Vis and IR spectroscopy, while the 
single-crystal X-ray diffraction investigation was successful in establishing 
the structures of these compounds. DFT calculations have been successfully made 
to correlate the experimental data. According to biological studies, the 
synthesized hydrazones significantly inhibited both butyrylcholinesterase 
(2-ClMHB: 20.95 ± 1.29 µM and 2-ClBHB: 31.21 ± 1.50 µM) and acetylcholinesterase 
(2-ClMHB: 21.80 ± 1.10 µM and 2-ClBHB: 10.38 ± 1.27 µM). Moreover, molecular 
docking was also employed to locate the molecule with the optimum interaction 
and stability as well as to explain the experimental findings. The compound's 
dynamic nature, binding interaction, and protein-ligand stability were 
investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Analyzing parameters 
such as RMSD and RMSF indicated that the compound remained stable throughout the 
100 ns MD simulation. Finally, the drugs displayed high oral bioavailability, as 
per projected ADME and pharmacokinetic parameters.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent and costly age-related dementia. 
Heritable factors account for 58-79% of variation in late-onset AD, but 
substantial variation remains in age-of- onset, disease severity, and whether 
those with high-risk genotypes acquire AD. To emulate the diversity of human 
populations, we utilized the AD-BXD mouse panel. This genetically diverse 
resource combines AD genotypes with multiple BXD strains to discover new genetic 
drivers of AD resilience. Comparing AD-BXD carriers to noncarrier littermates, 
we computed a novel quantitative metric for resilience to cognitive decline in 
the AD-BXDs. Our quantitative AD resilience trait was heritable and genetic 
mapping identified a locus on chr8 associated with resilience to AD mutations 
that resulted in amyloid brain pathology. Using a hippocampus proteomics 
dataset, we nominated the mitochondrial glutathione S reductase protein (GR or 
GSHR) as a resilience factor, finding that the DBA/2J genotype was associated 
with substantially higher GR abundance. By mapping protein QTLs (pQTLs), we 
identified synaptic organization and mitochondrial proteins coregulated in trans 
with a cis-pQTL for GR. We found four coexpression modules correlated with the 
quantitative resilience score in aged 5XFAD mice using paracliques, which were 
related to cell structure, protein folding, and postsynaptic densities. Finally, 
we found significant positive associations between human GSR transcript 
abundance in the brain and better outcomes on AD-related cognitive and pathology 
traits in the Religious Orders Study/Memory and Aging project (ROSMAP). Taken 
together, these data support a framework for resilience in which neuronal 
antioxidant pathway activity provides for stability of synapses within the 
hippocampus.

BACKGROUND: Hepcidin is the master regulator of iron homeostasis. Hepcidin 
downregulation has been demonstrated in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
patients. However, the mechanism underlying the role of hepcidin downregulation 
in cognitive impairment has not been elucidated.
METHODS: In the present study, we generated GFAP-Cre-mediated hepcidin 
conditional knockout mice (HampGFAP cKO) to explore the effect of hepcidin 
deficiency on hippocampal structure and neurocognition.
RESULTS: We found that the HampGFAP cKO mice developed AD-like brain atrophy and 
memory deficits. In particular, the weight of the hippocampus and the number of 
granule neurons in the dentate gyrus were significantly reduced. Further 
investigation demonstrated that the morphological change in the hippocampus of 
HampGFAP cKO mice was attributed to impaired neurogenesis caused by decreased 
proliferation of neural stem cells. Regarding the molecular mechanism, increased 
iron content after depletion of hepcidin followed by an elevated level of the 
inflammatory factor tumor necrosis factor-α accounted for the impairment of 
hippocampal neurogenesis in HampGFAP cKO mice. These observations were further 
verified in GFAP promoter-driven hepcidin knockdown mice and in 
Nestin-Cre-mediated hepcidin conditional knockout mice.
CONCLUSIONS: The present findings demonstrated a critical role for hepcidin in 
hippocampal neurogenesis and validated the importance of iron and associated 
inflammatory cytokines as key modulators of neurodevelopment, providing insights 
into the potential pathogenesis of cognitive dysfunction and related treatments.

Apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE4) is the predominant genetic risk factor for 
late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). APOE4 mouse models have provided advances 
in the understanding of disease pathogenesis, but unaccounted variables like 
rodent housing status may hinder translational outcomes. Non-sterile aspects 
like food and bedding can be major sources of changes in rodent microflora. 
Alterations in intestinal microbial ecology can cause mucosal barrier impairment 
and increase pro-inflammatory signals. The present study examined the role of 
sterile and non-sterile food and housing on redox indicators and the immune 
status of humanized-APOE4 knock-in mice (hAPOe4). hAPOE4 mice were housed under 
sterile conditions until 22 months of age, followed by the transfer of a cohort 
of mice to non-sterile housing for 2 months. At 24 months of age, the 
redox/immunologic status was evaluated by flow cytometry/ELISA. hAPOE4 females 
housed under non-sterile conditions exhibited: (1) higher neuronal and 
microglial oxygen radical production and (2) lower CD68+ microglia (brain) and 
CD8+ T cells (periphery) compared to sterile-housed mice. In contrast, hAPOE4 
males in non-sterile housing exhibited: (1) higher MHCII+ microglia and 
CD11b+CD4+ T cells (brain) and (2) higher CD11b+CD4+ T cells and levels of 
lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and inflammatory cytokines in the periphery 
relative to sterile-housed mice. This study demonstrated that sterile vs. 
non-sterile housing conditions are associated with the activation of redox and 
immune responses in the brain and periphery in a sex-dependent manner. 
Therefore, housing status may contribute to variable outcomes in both the brain 
and periphery.

Saffron has many pharmacological properties in addition to being a frequently 
used food seasoning. Crocin and picrocrocin which accumulate in saffron stigma, 
are responsible for these pharmacological properties. These natural products 
have health-promoting effects for the prevention and treatment of numerous 
diseases, including age-related cognitive and memory disfunction. Currently, 
crocin and picrocrocin are obtained from saffron, considered as the spice with 
the highest price in the market. To develop an efficient and low-cost approach 
to producing these compounds with high bioactivity, biosynthetic genes isolated 
from saffron can be exploited in the metabolic engineering of heterologous hosts 
and the production of crocins in productive crop plants. Recently, we engineered 
tomato fruit producing crocins (Tomafran). In this study, we demonstrated that 
crocin-rich extract, encapsulated in chitosan or in exosomes may function as a 
neuroprotective strategy. Crocins contained in the Tomafran extracts and much 
lower doses in chitosan nanoparticles or exosomes were enough to rescue the 
neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y after damage caused by okadaic acid. Our results 
confirm the neuroprotective effect of Tomafran and its exosomes that may be 
useful for the delay or prevention of neurodegenerative disorders such as 
Alzheimer's disease.

Honey-iQfood is an herbal supplement made of a mixture of polyherbal extracts 
and wild honey. The mixture is traditionally claimed to improve various 
conditions related to brain cells and functions including dementia and 
Alzheimer's disease. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β) and 
cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) have been identified as being involved in the 
pathological hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins, which leads to the formation 
of neurofibrillary tangles and causes Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, this study 
was conducted to confirm the traditional claims by detection of active 
compounds, namely curcumin, gallic acid, catechin, rosmarinic acid, and 
andrographolide in the raw materials of Honey-iQfood through HPLC analysis, 
molecular docking, and dynamic simulations. Two potential compounds, 
andrographolide, and rosmarinic acid, produced the best binding affinities 
following the molecular docking of the active compounds against the GSK-3β and 
CDK5 targets. Andrographolide binds with GSK-3β at -8.2 kcal/mol, whereas 
rosmarinic acid binds to CDK5 targets at -8.6 kcal/mol. Molecular dynamics was 
further carried out to confirm the docking results and clarify their dynamic 
properties such as RMSD, RMSF, rGyr, SASA, PSA, and binding free energy. 
CDK5-andrographolide complexes had the best MM-GBSA score (-83.63 kcal/mol) 
compared to other complexes, indicating the better interaction profile and 
stability of the complex. These findings warrant further research into 
andrographolide and rosmarinic acid as efficient inhibitors of tau protein 
hyperphosphorylation to verify their therapeutic potential in brain-related 
illnesses.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

BACKGROUND: Gut microbiota could affect the onset and development of vascular 
cognitive impairment (VCI) through modulating metabolic and immune pathways. 
However, the vascular mechanisms involved remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the gut microbiota associated with VCI and examine the 
mediating effects of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) to explore potential 
therapeutic targets for VCI.
METHODS: This prospective study enrolled patients with VCI (n = 16) and healthy 
controls (n = 18) from the Chinese Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle study 
between January 1 and June 30, 2022. The gut microbiota composition and 
diversity were determined by 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. The association 
between gut microbiota and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores was 
determined using Spearman's correlation analysis. Regional CBF was calculated 
using pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling. The mediating effects of 
regional CBF on the relationship between specific gut microbiota and cognition 
in VCI were investigated using mediation analysis.
RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, patients with VCI had significantly 
greater abundance of Bifidobacterium, Veillonella, R uminococcus gnavus , 
Fusobacterium, and Erysipelatoclostridium and smaller abundance of Collinsella. 
The abundance of Ruminococcus gnavus was negatively associated with MoCA scores 
in patients with VCI, with the CBF in the left hypothalamus, right hypothalamus, 
and left amygdala accounting for 63.96%, 48.22%, and 36.51%, respectively, of 
this association after adjusting for confounders.
CONCLUSIONS: Ruminococcus gnavus is associated with cognition in VCI, which is 
strongly mediated by CBF in the bilateral hypothalamus and left amygdala. These 
findings highlight the potential regulatory roles of nutrition and 
metabolism-related areas of the brain in VCI.

It is of great significance for the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) to achieve the on-site activity evaluation of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), 
the hydrolase of acetylcholine (ACh). Herein, we have developed a biosensing 
method endowed with considerable superiority based on the organic-inorganic 
hybrid composite Eu(DPA)3@Lap with excellent stability and fluorescent 
properties for this purpose by loading Eu3+ ions and 2,6-dipicolinic acid (DPA) 
into LAPONITE® (Lap). Through the comprehensive consideration of the specific 
hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine (ATCh) into thiocholine (TCh) by AChE, the high 
binding affinity of TCh to copper ion (Cu2+), and the selective fluorescence 
quenching ability of Cu2+, a simple Eu(DPA)3@Lap-based assay was developed to 
realize the rapid and convenient evaluation of AChE activity. Owning to the 
facile signal on-off-on response mode with a clear PET-based sensing mechanism, 
our assay presents favorable selectivity and sensitivity (LOD of 0.5 mU mL-1). 
Furthermore, the fluorescent assay was successfully applied for assessing AChE 
activity in human serum samples and screening potential AChE inhibitors, showing 
potential for application in the early diagnosis and drug screening of AD, as a 
new development path of AD therapy.

Numerous anti-amyloid therapies have seen recent clinical development and 
approval, such as the monoclonal antibodies aducanumab and lecanemab. However, 
in Alzheimer's disease patients, amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques are found embedded in 
the extracellular matrix and surrounded by collagens, which might hinder these 
antibodies from targeting the plaques. We reasoned that various different 
nutraceutical and pharmaceutical agents might induce collagen and extracellular 
matrix turnover and removal of these collagen-embedded amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques. 
To address this idea, here, we used a transgenic C. elegans strain, LSD2104 , 
expressing fluorescent human Aβ 1-42 as an in-vivo model for secreted amyloid 
aggregation in the extracellular matrix. We performed a screen of various 
nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals along with different combinations, and we 
found that quercetin 350 µM and rifampicin 75 µM successfully cleared the 
extracellular amyloid plaque burden compared to the 0.2% DMSO control group, 
with a combination of the two agents producing the maximum effect compared to 
either drug alone. These results may implicate the exploration of combination 
therapeutics of nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals in the clearance of amyloid-β 
(Aβ) plaques in Alzheimer's disease.

Metabolic diseases derived from an unhealthy lifestyle have been linked with an 
increased risk for developing cognitive impairment and even Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Although high consumption of saturated fatty acids such as palmitic acid 
(PA) has been associated with the development of obesity and type II diabetes, 
the mechanisms connecting elevated neuronal PA levels and increased AD marker 
expression remain unclear. Among other effects, PA induces insulin resistance, 
increases intracellular calcium and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, 
and reduces the NAD+/NADH ratio, resulting in decreased activity of the 
deacetylase Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) in neurons. These mechanisms may affect signaling 
pathways that impact the posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of the tau 
protein. To analyze the role played by PA in inducing the phosphorylation and 
acetylation of tau, we examined PTM changes in human tau in differentiated 
neurons from human neuroblastoma cells. We found changes in the phosphorylation 
state of several AD-related sites, namely, S199/202 and S214, that were mediated 
by a mechanism associated with the dysregulated activity of the kinases GSK3β 
and mTOR. PA also increased the acetylation of residue K280 and elevated total 
tau level after long exposure time. These findings provide information about the 
mechanisms by which saturated fatty acids cause tau PTMs that are similar to 
those observed in association with AD biochemical changes.

Update of
    medRxiv. 2023 Oct 31;:

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, poses a 
significant global burden. Diagnosis typically involves invasive and costly 
methods like neuroimaging or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker testing of 
phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and amyloid-β42/40 (Aβ42/40). Such procedures are 
especially impractical in resource-constrained regions, such as the Democratic 
Republic of Congo (DRC). Blood-based biomarker testing may provide a more 
accessible screening opportunity.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine if AD-related blood-based biomarkers are 
associated with cognitive test performance in the Congolese population, where 
limited research has been conducted.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study of 81 Congolese individuals, cognitive 
assessments (Alzheimer's Questionnaire (AQ) and Community Screening Interview 
for Dementia (CSID)) distinguished dementia cases from controls. Blood draws 
were taken to assess p-tau 181 and Aβ42/40 biomarkers. Relationships between the 
biomarkers and cognitive performance were analyzed using multiple linear 
regression models.
RESULTS: Lower plasma Aβ42/40 was significantly associated with lower CSID 
scores and higher AQ scores, indicative of AD (p < 0.001). These relationships 
were observed in healthy controls (CSID p = 0.01, AQ p = 0.03), but not in 
dementia cases. However, p-tau 181 did not exhibit significant associations with 
either measure. Factors such as age, sex, education, presence of APOEɛ4 allele, 
did not alter these relationships.
CONCLUSIONS: Understanding relationships between AD-related screening tests and 
blood biomarkers is a step towards utilization of blood-based biomarker tests as 
a screening tool for AD, especially in resource-limited regions. Further 
research should be conducted to evaluate blood biomarker test efficacy in larger 
samples and other populations.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, with 
sporadic form being the predominant type. Neuroinflammation plays a critical 
role in accelerating pathogenic processes in AD. Mesenchymal stem cell 
(MSC)-derived small extracellular vesicles (MSC-sEVs) regulate inflammatory 
responses and show great promise for treating AD. Induced pluripotent stem cell 
(iPSC)-derived MSCs are similar to MSCs and exhibit low immunogenicity and 
heterogeneity, making them promising cell sources for clinical applications. 
This study examined the anti-inflammatory effects of MSC-sEVs in a 
streptozotocin-induced sporadic mouse model of AD (sAD). The intracisternal 
administration of iPSC-MSC-sEVs alleviated NLRP3/GSDMD-mediated 
neuroinflammation, decreased amyloid deposition and neuronal apoptosis, and 
mitigated cognitive dysfunction. Furthermore, it explored the role of miR-223-3p 
in the iPSC-MSC-sEVs-mediated anti-inflammatory effects in vitro. miR-223-3p 
directly targeted NLRP3, whereas inhibiting miR-223-3p almost completely 
reversed the suppression of NLRP3 by MSC-sEVs, suggesting that miR-223-3p may, 
at least partially, account for MSC-sEVs-mediated anti-inflammation. Results 
obtained suggest that intracisternal administration of iPSC-MSC-sEVs can reduce 
cognitive impairment by inhibiting NLRP3/GSDMD neuroinflammation in a sAD mouse 
model. Therefore, the present study provides a proof-of-principle for applying 
iPSC-MSC-sEVs to target neuroinflammation in sAD.

PURPOSE: Antipsychotic use in Alzheimer disease (AD) is associated with adverse 
events and mortality. Whilst postulated to cause/exacerbate orthostatic 
hypotension (OH), the exact relationship between antipsychotic use and OH has 
never been explored in AD-a group who are particularly vulnerable to 
neuro-cardiovascular instability and adverse effects of medication on 
orthostatic blood pressure (BP) behaviour.
METHODS: We analysed longitudinal data from an 18-month trial of Nilvadipine in 
mild-moderate AD. We assessed the effect of long-term antipsychotic use (for the 
entire 18-month study duration) on orthostatic BP phenotypes measured on eight 
occasions, in addition to the relationship between antipsychotic use, BP 
phenotypes and incident falls.
RESULTS: Of 509 older adults with AD (aged 72.9 ± 8.3 years, 61.9% female), 
10.6% (n = 54) were prescribed a long-term antipsychotic. Over 18 months, 
long-term antipsychotic use was associated with a greater likelihood of 
experiencing sit-to-stand OH (ssOH) (OR: 1.21; 1.05-1.38, p = 0.009) which 
persisted on covariate adjustment. Following adjustment for important clinical 
confounders, both antipsychotic use (IRR: 1.80, 1.11-2.92, p = 0.018) and ssOH 
(IRR: 1.44, 1.00-2.06, p = 0.048) were associated with a greater risk of 
falls/syncope over 18 months in older adults with mild-moderate AD.
CONCLUSION: Even in mild-to-moderate AD, long-term antipsychotic use was 
associated with ssOH. Both antipsychotic use and ssOH were associated with a 
greater risk of incident falls/syncope over 18 months. Further attention to 
optimal prescribing interventions in this cohort is warranted and may involve 
screening older adults with AD prescribed antipsychotics for both orthostatic 
symptoms and falls.

The usefulness of Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) potential as a biomarker 
of neurocognitive disorders due to possible Alzheimer's disease, is based on its 
possible physiological correlates. However, its application in the diagnostic 
evaluation of these disorders is still incipient. The aim of this study is to 
characterize the patterns of cognitive processing of information in the domain 
of nonspecific global attention, by recording potential CNV in a group of 
patients with neurocognitive disorders due to possible Alzheimer's disease. An 
experimental study of cases and controls was carried out. The sample included 39 
patients classified according to DSM-5 with a neurocognitive disorder subtype 
possibly due Alzheimer's disease, and a Control Group of 53 subjects with normal 
cognitive functions. CNV potential was registered using standard protocol. The 
analysis of variance obtained significant differences in mean values and 
confidence intervals of total CNV amplitude between the three study groups. The 
late CNV segment amplitudes makes it possible to discriminate between the level 
of mild and major dysfunction in the group of patients. The CNV total amplitudes 
of potential allows for effective discrimination between normal cognitive 
functioning and neurocognitive disorders due to possible Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is vital for early 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, though confirming specific biomarkers 
remains challenging. Our proposed Multi-Scale Self-Attention Network (MUSAN) 
enhances classification of cognitively normal (CN) and AD individuals, 
distinguishing stable (sMCI) from progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI).
OBJECTIVE: This study leverages AD structural atrophy properties to achieve 
precise AD classification, combining different scales of brain region features. 
The ultimate goal is an interpretable algorithm for this method.
METHODS: The MUSAN takes whole-brain sMRI as input, enabling automatic 
extraction of brain region features and modeling of correlations between 
different scales of brain regions, and achieves personalized disease 
interpretation of brain regions. Furthermore, we also employed an occlusion 
sensitivity algorithm to localize and visualize brain regions sensitive to 
disease.
RESULTS: Our method is applied to ADNI-1, ADNI-2, and ADNI-3, and achieves high 
performance on the classification of CN from AD with accuracy (0.93), 
specificity (0.82), sensitivity (0.96), and area under curve (AUC) (0.95), as 
well as notable performance on the distinguish of sMCI from pMCI with accuracy 
(0.85), specificity (0.84), sensitivity (0.74), and AUC (0.86). Our sensitivity 
masking algorithm identified key regions in distinguishing CN from AD: 
hippocampus, amygdala, and vermis. Moreover, cingulum, pallidum, and inferior 
frontal gyrus are crucial for sMCI and pMCI discrimination. These discoveries 
align with existing literature, confirming the dependability of our model in AD 
research.
CONCLUSION: Our method provides an effective AD diagnostic and conversion 
prediction method. The occlusion sensitivity algorithm enhances deep learning 
interpretability, bolstering AD research reliability.

BACKGROUND: Jiaohong pills (JHP) consist of Pericarpium Zanthoxyli (PZ) and 
Radix Rehmanniae, two herbs that have been extensively investigated over many 
years due to their potential protective effects against cognitive decline and 
memory impairment. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the beneficial 
effects remain elusive. Here, research studies were conducted to investigate and 
validate the therapeutic effects of JHP on Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: BV-2 cell inflammation was induced by lipopolysaccharide. AD mice were 
administered amyloid-β (Aβ). Behavioral experiments were used to evaluate 
learning and memory ability. The levels of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis 
factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were 
detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The protein 
expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the phosphorylation 
level of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa-B 
(NF-κB) were detected using Western blot. Nissl staining was used to detect 
neuronal degeneration.
RESULTS: The results demonstrated that an alcoholic extract of PZ significantly 
decreased the levels of NO, IL-1β, TNF-α, and iNOS; increased the expression 
level of IL-10; and significantly decreased the phosphorylation levels of MAPK 
and NF-κB. These inhibitory effects were further confirmed in the AD mouse 
model. Meanwhile, JHP improved learning and memory function in AD mice, reduced 
neuronal damage, and enriched the Nissl bodies in the hippocampus. Moreover, 
IL-1β and TNF-α in the cortex were significantly downregulated after JHP 
administration, whereas IL-10 showed increased expression.
CONCLUSIONS: It was found that JHP reduced neuroinflammatory response in AD mice 
by targeting the MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway.

Risk factors contributing to dementia are multifactorial. Accumulating evidence 
suggests a role for pathogens as risk factors, but data is largely correlative 
with few causal relationships. Here, we demonstrate that intermittent murine 
cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection of mice, alters blood brain barrier (BBB) 
permeability and metabolic pathways. Increased basal mitochondrial function is 
observed in brain microvessels cells (BMV) exposed to intermittent MCMV 
infection and is accompanied by elevated levels of superoxide. Further, mice 
score lower in cognitive assays compared to age-matched controls who were never 
administered MCMV. Our data show that repeated systemic infection with MCMV, 
increases markers of neuroinflammation, alters mitochondrial function, increases 
markers of oxidative stress and impacts cognition. Together, this suggests that 
viral burden may be a risk factor for dementia. These observations provide 
possible mechanistic insights through which pathogens may contribute to the 
progression or exacerbation of dementia.

Vascular dementia is the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer's 
disease. Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion is a key contributor to the development 
of vascular dementia. In this chapter, we describe the surgical procedures used 
for bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) surgery to induce chronic cerebral 
hypoperfusion. Mice that undergo BCAS surgery develop the hallmarks of vascular 
dementia including white matter lesions, neuroinflammation, and cognitive 
impairment. This technique may be used for studies of chronic cerebral 
hypoperfusion and vascular dementia in mice.

The low sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a major bottleneck 
for studying biomolecular structures of complex biomolecular assemblies. 
Cryogenically cooled probe technology overcomes the sensitivity limitations 
enabling NMR applications to challenging biomolecular systems. Here we describe 
solid-state NMR studies of the human blood protein vitronectin (Vn) bound to 
hydroxyapatite (HAP), the mineralized form of calcium phosphate, using a 
CryoProbe designed for magic angle spinning (MAS) experiments. Vn is a major 
blood protein that regulates many different physiological and pathological 
processes. The high sensitivity of the CryoProbe enabled us to acquire 
three-dimensional solid-state NMR spectra for sequential assignment and 
characterization of site-specific water-protein interactions that provide 
initial insights into the organization of the Vn-HAP complex. Vn associates with 
HAP in various pathological settings, including macular degeneration eyes and 
Alzheimer's disease brains. The ability to probe these assemblies at atomic 
detail paves the way for understanding their formation.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in 
neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and cognition. BDNF is a neurotrophin that 
binds to tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), a specific receptor on target 
cell surfaces; it acts on neuronal formation, development, growth, and repair 
via transcription factors, such as cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), 
and it is involved in learning and memory. BDNF expression is decreased in 
patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Exercise and the intake of several 
different foods or ingredients can increase BDNF expression, as confirmed with 
lutein, xanthophylls (polar carotenoids), and ethanolamine plasmalogen (PlsEtn), 
which are present at high levels in the brain. This study examined the effects 
of combining lutein and PlsEtn using lutein-rich Chlorella and ascidian extracts 
containing high levels of PlsEtn bearing docosahexaenoic acid, which is abundant 
in the human brain, on the activation of the BDNF-TrkB-CREB signaling pathway in 
the hippocampus of Sprague-Dawley rats. Although activation of the 
BDNF-TrkB-CREB signaling pathway in the hippocampus was not observed in 
Chlorella or ascidian PlsEtn monotherapy, activation was observed with 
combination therapy at an equal dose. The results of this study suggest that the 
combination of Chlorella and ascidian PlsEtn may have a preventive effect 
against dementia, including AD.

BACKGROUND: Among the older adults, hearing impairment is a common problem and 
may contribute to dementia.
OBJECTIVE: Therefore, we aimed to examine the association between hearing 
impairment and the risk of dementia among older adults in South Korea.
METHODS: Using the Korean National Health Insurance Service-Senior Cohort from 
2005 to 2019, we collected data of 44,728 patients. Hearing impairment was 
determined using the national disability registry. Propensity score matching 
(1:1) was performed to match patients with and without hearing impairment (case: 
22,364, control: 22,364). A Cox proportional hazards regression model was built 
to analyze the association between hearing impairment and dementia.
RESULTS: Patients with hearing impairment had a higher risk of dementia than 
those without hearing impairment (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.28, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] = 1.23-1.34). Assessing the degree of disability, both severe 
(HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.16-1.35) and mild conditions (HR = 1.29, 95% 
CI = 1.23-1.35) had an increased risk of dementia, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Older patients with hearing impairment exhibit an increased risk of 
dementia, thereby warranting a new approach to dementia care among these 
patients regardless of the degree of hearing impairment.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers can help differentiate 
cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 
dementia. The role of AD biomarkers in predicting cognitive impairment and AD 
needs examination.
METHODS: In 628 CU individuals from a multi-ethnic cohort, amyloid beta (Aβ)42, 
Aβ40, phosphorylated tau-181 (p-tau181), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), 
and neurofilament light chain (NfL) were measured in plasma.
RESULTS: Higher baseline levels of p-tau181/Aβ42 ratio were associated with an 
increased risk of incident dementia. A biomarker pattern (with elevated 
Aβ42/Aβ40 but low p-tau181/Aβ42) was associated with decreased dementia risk. 
Compared to CU, participants who developed MCI or dementia had a rapid decrease 
in this protective biomarker pattern reflecting AD-specific pathological change.
DISCUSSION: Elevated levels of AD biomarker p-tau181/Aβ42, by itself or combined 
with a low Aβ42/Aβ40 level, predicts clinically diagnosed AD. Individuals with a 
rapid change in these biomarkers may need close monitoring for the potential 
downward trajectory of cognition.
HIGHLIGHTS: We discuss a multi-ethnic, urban community study of elderly 
individuals. The study consisted of a longitudinal assessment over 6 years with 
repeated clinical assessments. The study used blood-based biomarkers as 
predictors of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: Identifying individuals before the onset of overt symptoms is key in 
the prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
OBJECTIVES: Investigate the use of miRNA as early blood-biomarker of cognitive 
decline in older adults.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
SETTING: Two observational cohorts (CHARIOT-PRO, Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)).
PARTICIPANTS: 830 individuals without overt clinical symptoms from CHARIOT-PRO 
and 812 individuals from ADNI.
MEASUREMENTS: qPCR analysis of a prioritised set of 38 miRNAs in the blood of 
individuals from CHARIOT-PRO, followed by a brain-specific functional enrichment 
analysis for the significant miRNAs. In ADNI, genetic association analysis for 
polymorphisms within the significant miRNAs' genes and CSF levels of 
phosphorylated-tau, total-tau, amyloid-β42, soluble-TREM2 and BACE1 activity 
using whole genome sequencing data. Post-hoc analysis using multi-omics 
datasets.
RESULTS: Six miRNAs (hsa-miR-128-3p, hsa-miR-144-5p, hsa-miR-146a-5p, 
hsa-miR-26a-5p, hsa-miR-29c-3p and hsa-miR-363-3p) were downregulated in the 
blood of individuals with low cognitive performance on the Repeatable Battery 
for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). The pathway enrichment 
analysis indicated involvement of apoptosis and inflammation, relevant in early 
AD stages. Polymorphisms within genes encoding for hsa-miR-29c-3p and 
hsa-miR-146a-5p were associated with CSF levels of amyloid-β42, soluble-TREM2 
and BACE1 activity, and 21 variants were eQTL for hippocampal MIR29C expression.
CONCLUSIONS: six miRNAs may serve as potential blood biomarker of subclinical 
cognitive deficits in AD. Polymorphisms within these miRNAs suggest a possible 
interplay between the amyloid cascade and microglial activation at preclinical 
stages of AD.

BACKGROUND: Although social cognitive dysfunction is a major feature of the 
behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), quantitative measurement 
of social behavior changes is poorly available in clinical settings.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to evaluate diagnostic accuracy of 
social-emotional questionnaires in distinguishing bvFTD from healthy control 
(HC) subjects and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients.
METHODS: We enrolled 29 bvFTD, 24 AD, and 18 HC subjects matched for age, sex, 
and education. Two informant-based measures of socio-emotional sensitivity and 
empathy (i.e., revised Self-Monitoring Scale (rSMS) and Interpersonal Reactivity 
Index (IRI)) were administered. One-way ANOVA was performed to compare groups, 
whereas Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve analysis tested 
questionnaire ability in distinguishing groups. A short version of IRI (sIRI) 
was obtained by excluding the non-contributing subscale (i.e., personal 
distress).
RESULTS: Compared to HC and AD, bvFTD showed significantly lower scores in rSMS 
and IRI scores, except for IRI personal distress subscale. The sIRI showed an 
excellent performance in early diagnosis (bvFTD versus HC = AUC 0.95). Both sIRI 
and rSMS showed good performance in distinguishing bvFTD from AD (AUC 0.83).
CONCLUSIONS: ROC analyses support the usefulness of informant social 
questionnaires in memory clinics and their potential value in screening 
procedures for research eligibility in forthcoming trials. In the timely 
diagnosis of bvFTD patients, IRI and rSMS may supply crucial information for the 
early detection of signs and symptoms affecting social-emotional skills, which 
might otherwise be underrecognized.

This study was undertaken to identify and characterize the first ligands capable 
of selectively identifying nicotinic acetylcholine receptors containing α7 and 
β2 subunits (α7β2-nAChR subtype). Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons express 
α7β2-nAChR. Here, they appear to mediate neuronal dysfunction induced by the 
elevated levels of oligomeric amyloid-β associated with early Alzheimer's 
disease. Additional work indicates that α7β2-nAChR are expressed across several 
further critically important cholinergic and GABAergic neuronal circuits within 
the central nervous system. Further studies, however, are significantly hindered 
by the inability of currently available ligands to distinguish heteromeric 
α7β2-nAChR from the closely related and more widespread homomeric α7-only-nAChR 
subtype. Functional screening using two-electrode voltage-clamp 
electrophysiology identified a family of α7β2-nAChR-selective analogs of 
α-conotoxin PnIC (α-CtxPnIC). A combined electrophysiology, functional kinetics, 
site-directed mutagenesis, and molecular dynamics approach was used to further 
characterize the α7β2-nAChR selectivity and site of action of these α-CtxPnIC 
analogs. We determined that α7β2-nAChR selectivity of α-CtxPnIC analogs arises 
from interactions at a site distinct from the orthosteric agonist-binding site 
shared between α7β2- and α7-only-nAChR. As numerous previously identified α-Ctx 
ligands are competitive antagonists of orthosteric agonist-binding sites, this 
study profoundly expands the scope of use of α-Ctx ligands (which have already 
provided important nAChR research and translational breakthroughs). More 
immediately, analogs of α-CtxPnIC promise to enable, for the first time, both 
comprehensive mapping of the distribution of α7β2-nAChR and detailed 
investigations of their physiological roles.

The increasing nanoparticle (NP) applications in the biomedical field have 
become an emerging concern regarding human health. NP exposure may play a role 
in the accelerating Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression; however, the etiology 
of this disorder is complex and remains largely unclear. Here, we identified 
that intravenous injection of silica NPs (SiNPs) caused the blood-brain barrier 
breakdown via downregulating tight junction-related gene expressions. Meanwhile, 
SiNPs upregulate the transport receptor for advanced glycation end products 
(RAGE) that govern the β-amyloid (Aβ) influx to the brain; however, low-density 
lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) that controls the efflux of Aβ 
from the brain was not affected. Consequently, an increase in Aβ burden in the 
brain of SiNP-challenged APP/PS1 mice was found. Intriguingly, plasma 
apolipoprotein E (ApoE) adsorbed on the surface of SiNPs partially relieves this 
effect. Using ApoE knockout (ApoE-/-) mice, we confirmed that SiNPs covered with 
serum without ApoE showed further elevated AD symptoms. Together, this study 
offered a compilation of data to support the potential risk factors of NP 
exposure and AD pathology.

BACKGROUND: Family caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease experience 
conflicts as they navigate health care but lack training to resolve these 
disputes. We sought to develop and pilot test an artificial-intelligence 
negotiation training program, NegotiAge, for family caregivers.
METHODS: We convened negotiation experts, a geriatrician, a social worker, and 
community-based family caregivers. Content matter experts created short videos 
to teach negotiation skills. Caregivers generated dialogue surrounding 
conflicts. Computer scientists utilized the dialogue with the Interactive 
Arbitration Guide Online (IAGO) platform to develop avatar-based agents (e.g., 
sibling, older adult, physician) for caregivers to practice negotiating. Pilot 
testing was conducted with family caregivers to assess usability (USE) and 
satisfaction (open-ended questions with thematic analysis).
RESULTS: Development: With NegotiAge, caregivers progress through didactic 
material, then receive scenarios to negotiate (e.g., physician recommends 
gastric tube, sibling disagrees with home support, older adult refusing 
support). Caregivers negotiate in real-time with avatars who are designed to act 
like humans, including emotional tactics and irrational behaviors. Caregivers 
send/receive offers, using tactics until either mutual agreement or time 
expires. Immediate feedback is generated for the user to improve skills 
training. Pilot testing: Family caregivers (n = 12) completed the program and 
survey. USE questionnaire (Likert scale 1-7) subset scores revealed: (1) 
Useful-Mean 5.69 (SD 0.76); (2) Ease-Mean 5.24 (SD 0.96); (3) Learn-Mean 5.69 
(SD 0.74); (4) Satisfy-Mean 5.62 (SD 1.10). Items that received over 80% 
agreements were: It helps me be more effective; It helps me be more productive; 
It is useful; It gives me more control over the activities in my life; It makes 
the things I want to accomplish easier to get done. Participants were highly 
satisfied and found NegotiAge fun to use (91.7%), with 100% who would recommend 
it to a friend.
CONCLUSION: NegotiAge is an Artificial-Intelligent Caregiver Negotiation 
Program, that is usable and feasible for family caregivers to become familiar 
with negotiating conflicts commonly seen in health care.

A Duty to Care: Male Perspectives on the Caregiver Role for Persons With 
Alzheimer's or Dementia.

The population of family caregivers (FCGs) of persons with Alzheimer's disease 
and related dementias (ADRD) is growing, as is the proportion of males taking on 
this traditionally female role. Caregiving research has centered around women 
due to historic roles, resulting in a knowledge gap regarding male caregiving 
experiences. The purpose of this qualitative descriptive study was to explore 
the experiences of male FCGs of people with ADRD. Eleven male caregivers were 
recruited and interviewed by telephone or Zoom/videoconferencing. Data were 
analyzed using thematic analysis. Four major themes emerged highlighting males' 
struggles with the unfamiliar caregiving role and changing identity; their 
acknowledgment of personal growth and discovery through caregiving; their 
challenges in finding the "right" kind of support; and their perceived reshaping 
of masculinity through the caregiving role. Male caregivers expressed unique 
experiences as FCGs. Findings indicate the need for researchers and clinicians 
to develop tailored support to address their needs.

The aging global population is placing an increasing burden on healthcare 
systems, and the social impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is on the rise. 
However, the availability of safe and effective treatments for AD remains 
limited. Adoptive Treg therapy has been explored for treating neurodegenerative 
diseases, including AD. To facilitate the clinical application of Treg therapy, 
we developed a Treg preparation protocol and highlighted the therapeutic effects 
of Tregs in 5xFAD mice. CD4+CD25+ Tregs, isolated after Aβ stimulation and 
expanded using a G-rex plate with a gas-permeable membrane, were adoptively 
transferred into 5xFAD mice. Behavioral analysis was conducted using Y-maze and 
passive avoidance tests. Additionally, we measured levels of Aβ, phosphorylated 
tau (pTAU), and nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) in the hippocampus. Real-time 
RT-PCR was employed to assess the mRNA levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory 
markers. Our findings indicate that Aβ-specific Tregs not only improved 
cognitive function but also reduced Aβ and pTAU accumulation in the hippocampus 
of 5xFAD mice. They also inhibited microglial neuroinflammation. These effects 
were observed at doses as low as 1.5 × 103 cells/head. Collectively, our results 
demonstrate that Aβ-specific Tregs can mitigate AD pathology in 5xFAD mice.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive assessment for foreign-born individuals is suboptimal. The 
Multicultural Cognitive Examination (MCE) was developed for use in culturally, 
linguistically and educationally diverse populations. The MCE includes the 
Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale (RUDAS) and performs assessment of 
memory, verbal fluency, and visuospatial function.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the psychometric properties of the Swedish version of the 
Multicultural Cognitive Examination (MCE-S) with the Swedish versions of the 
RUDAS (RUDAS-S), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE-SR), and the Clock 
Drawing Test (CDT), and to explore the ability of the MCE-S test to 
differentiate patients with and without dementia in a multicultural population.
METHODS: 117 outpatients at four memory clinics were tested using the MCE-S to 
complement the routine cognitive assessment.
RESULTS: Significant differences between patients with and without dementia were 
observed for all MCE-S components. There were significant differences between 
foreign-born and Swedish-born patients in the MMSE-SR, but not in the MCE-S or 
the RUDAS-S. The MCE-S, had good diagnostic performance for detecting dementia 
(AUC, 0.82), and was at least as good as the RUDAS-S alone (AUC, 0.79). The 
MCE-S also distinguished Alzheimer's disease (AD) from non-AD dementia. Contrary 
to expectations, the MCE-S was also at least as good as the MMSE-SR among the 
Swedish-born patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The MCE-S is adequate for detecting dementia in both foreign-born 
and Swedish-born populations. Based on the cultural diversity of general 
society, adapted cognitive tests that can be used for everyone are practical and 
beneficial for both patients and health-care professionals. Further studies are 
needed within primary care.

Specific metabolites have been reported to be potentially associated with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. However, the comprehensive understanding of roles 
of metabolite biomarkers in AD etiology remains elusive. We performed a large AD 
metabolome-wide association study (MWAS) by developing blood metabolite genetic 
prediction models. We evaluated associations between genetically predicted 
levels of metabolites and AD risk in 39,106 clinically diagnosed AD cases, 
46,828 proxy AD and related dementia (proxy-ADD) cases, and 401,577 controls. We 
further conducted analyses to determine microbiome features associated with the 
detected metabolites and characterize associations between predicted microbiome 
feature levels and AD risk. We identified fourteen metabolites showing an 
association with AD risk. Five microbiome features were further identified to be 
potentially related to associations of five of the metabolites. Our study 
provides new insights into the etiology of AD that involves blood metabolites 
and gut microbiome, which warrants further investigation.

14-3-3 is a family of conserved proteins that consist of seven isoforms which 
are highly expressed in the brain, and 14-3-3 zeta(ζ) is one of the isoforms 
encoded by the YWHAZ gene. Previous studies demonstrated that 14-3-3ζ is 
deposited in the neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains, and 
that 14-3-3ζ interacts with tau from the purified neurofibrillary tangles of AD 
brain extract. The present study examined the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 14-3-3ζ 
levels of 719 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI), including cognitively normal (CN) participants, patients with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) and patients with AD dementia, and aimed to identify 
whether CSF 14-3-3ζ is associated with tau pathology. CSF 14-3-3ζ levels were 
increased in AD, and particularly elevated among tau pathology positive 
individuals. CSF 14-3-3ζ levels were associated with CSF phosphorylated tau 181 
(p-tau) (r = 0.741, P < 0.001) and plasma p-tau (r = 0.293, P < 0.001), which 
are fluid biomarkers of tau pathology, and could predict tau pathology positive 
status with high accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve [AUC], 0.891). CSF 14-3-3ζ levels were also correlated to synaptic 
biomarker CSF GAP-43 (r = 0.609, P < 0.001) and neuroinflammatory biomarker CSF 
sTREM-2 (r = 0.507, P < 0.001). High CSF 14-3-3ζ levels at baseline were 
associated with progressive decline of cognitive function and neuroimaging 
findings during follow up. In conclusion, this study suggests that CSF 14-3-3ζ 
is a potential biomarker of AD that may be useful in clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Loneliness and social isolation are considered public health 
problems among older individuals. In addition, both increase the risk of 
developing cognitive impairment and dementia. The Social Loneliness construct 
has been proposed to refer to these harmful social interaction-related factors.
OBJECTIVE: To define the risk factors of Social Loneliness in individuals with 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and to analyze cognitive, emotional, and 
functional differences according to the participant's degree of Social 
Loneliness.
METHODS: Through convenience sampling, 105 participants over 60 diagnosed with 
MCI were selected. The evaluation consisted of anamnesis and a comprehensive 
neuropsychological examination. The ESTE-II questionnaire was used to assess 
Social Loneliness and its three factors: perceived social support, social 
participation, and use of communication technologies. Personality was measured 
with the NEO-FFI questionnaire.
RESULTS: The predictors of the Social Loneliness factors were as follows; 1) 
perceived social support (R2 = 0.33): Neuroticism (β= 0.353), depression 
(β= 0.205), and perceived health (β= 0.133); 2) social participation 
(R2 = 0.24): Conscientiousness (β= -0.344) and Extraversion (β= -0.263); 3) use 
of communication technologies (R2 = 0.44): age (β= 0.409), type of cohabitation 
(β= 0.331), cognitive reserve (β= -0.303), and Conscientiousness (β= -0.247); 
all p < 0.05. The participants with a higher degree of Social Loneliness showed 
more depressive symptoms (R2 = 0.133), more memory complaints (R2 = 0.086), 
worse perceived health (R2 = 0.147), lower attentional performance/processing 
speed (R2 = 0.094), and more naming difficulties (R2 = 0.132); all p < 0.05.
CONCLUSIONS: This research represents an advance in detecting individuals with 
MCI and an increased risk of developing Social Loneliness, which influences the 
configuration of the clinical profile of MCI.

BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein-E (APOE) genetic testing for Alzheimer's disease is 
becoming more important as clinical trials are increasingly targeting 
individuals carrying APOE-ε4 alleles. Little is known about the interest in 
finding out one's genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease in the general 
population. Our objective was to examine this in a sample of cognitively normal 
(CN) adults within a population-based online research registry with the goal to 
implement APOE-ε4 status for trial recruitment.
METHODS: An online survey was completed by 442 CN participants between the age 
of 49 and 75 years (56% female) from the Dutch Brain Research Registry. The 
survey assessed interest in participation in research into, and disclosure of, 
genetic risk for dementia. The survey assessed interest in participation in 
research into, and disclosure of, genetic risk for dementia and knowing their 
genetic risk in different hypothetical risk scenarios (10%, 30%, and 50% genetic 
risk for dementia at age 85, corresponding to APOEε2/ε2 or ε2/ε3, APOEε3/ε4 or 
ε2ε4, and APOE-ε4/ε4 genotypes). Cochran's Q and post hoc McNemar tests were 
used to analyse differences in frequencies across scenarios.
RESULTS: Most participants were interested in participating in research into and 
disclosure of their genetic risk (81%). The most reported reason was to 
contribute to scientific research (94%). Interest was higher in males, whilst 
lower-educated participants were more often undecided. When provided with 
different risk scenarios, interest in knowing their risk was somewhat higher in 
the scenarios with higher risk, i.e. in the 50% (79%) compared to the 10% 
scenario (73%;χ2(2) = 7.98; p = .005). Most individuals expected they would 
share their genetic risk with close relatives (77-89%), would participate in 
medication trials (79-88%), and would make long-term arrangements, e.g. 
retirement, health care, will (69-82%), with larger proportions for scenarios 
with higher hypothetical genetic risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the vast majority of CN adults 
participating in a research registry expresses interest in AD genetic risk 
research and disclosure. Interest in genetic risk disclosure is higher in 
scenarios corresponding to the APOE-ε4 genotype. This suggests APOE-ε4 screening 
within an online research registry is potentially a well-received method to 
accelerate inclusion for trials.

BACKGROUND: The behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is very 
heterogeneous in pathology, genetics, and disease course. Unlike Alzheimer's 
disease, reliable biomarkers are lacking and sporadic bvFTD is often 
misdiagnosed as a primary psychiatric disorder (PPD) due to overlapping clinical 
features. Current efforts to characterize and improve diagnostics are centered 
on the minority of genetic cases.
OBJECTIVE: The multi-center study DIPPA-FTD aims to develop diagnostic and 
prognostic algorithms to help distinguish sporadic bvFTD from late-onset PPD in 
its earliest stages.
METHODS: The prospective DIPPA-FTD study recruits participants with late-life 
behavioral changes, suspect for bvFTD or late-onset PPD diagnosis with a 
negative family history for FTD and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Subjects 
are invited to participate after diagnostic screening at participating memory 
clinics or recruited by referrals from psychiatric departments. At baseline 
visit, participants undergo neurological and psychiatric examination, 
questionnaires, neuropsychological tests, and brain imaging. Blood is obtained 
to investigate biomarkers. Patients are informed about brain donation programs. 
Follow-up takes place 10-14 months after baseline visit where all examinations 
are repeated. Results from the DIPPA-FTD study will be integrated in a 
data-driven approach to develop diagnostic and prognostic models.
CONCLUSIONS: DIPPA-FTD will make an important contribution to early sporadic 
bvFTD identification. By recruiting subjects with ambiguous or prodromal 
diagnoses, our research strategy will allow the characterization of early 
disease stages that are not covered in current sporadic FTD research. Results 
will hopefully increase the ability to diagnose sporadic bvFTD in the early 
stage and predict progression rate, which is pivotal for patient stratification 
and trial design.

Inhibitory Impacts of Fulvic Acid-Coated Iron Oxide Nanoparticles on the Amyloid 
Fibril Aggregations.

Jomehpour D, Sheikhlary S, Heydari E, Ara MHM.

Alzheimer's disease is considered as multi-factor diseases, the main hallmarks 
of which are extracellular amyloid-beta and intracellular tau protein 
aggregations, leading to neural death. With this in mind, most of the studies 
have been focused on eliminating these aggregations. Fulvic acid is one of the 
polyphenolic compounds which exhibits strong anti-inflammation and 
anti-amyloidogenic effects. On the other hand, iron oxide nanoparticles are able 
to reduce/eliminate the amyloid aggregations. Here in, the effect of fulvic 
acid-coated iron-oxide nanoparticles on the commonly used in-vitro model for 
amyloid aggregation studies, i. e., lysozyme from chicken egg white was 
investigated. The chicken egg white lysozyme forms the amyloid aggregation under 
acidic pH and high heat. The average size of nanoparticles was 10.7±2.7 nm. 
FESEM, XRD, and FTIR confirmed that fulvic acid was coated onto the surface of 
the nanoparticles. The inhibitory effects of the nanoparticles were verified by 
Thioflavin T assay, CD, and FESEM analysis. Furthermore, the toxicity of the 
nanoparticles on the neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y was assessed through MTT assay. Our 
results indicate that these nanoparticles efficiently inhibit amyloid 
aggregation formation, while exhibiting no in-vitro toxicity. This data shed 
light on the anti-amyloid activity of the nanodrug; paving the way for future 
drug development for treating Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered to be the borderline 
of cognitive changes associated with aging and very early dementia. Cognitive 
functions in MCI can improve, remain stable or progress to clinically probable 
AD. Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) can become a useful tool for 
using the analytical techniques to quantify EEG patterns indicating cognitive 
impairment.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to assess spectral and connectivity analysis 
of the EEG resting state activity in amnestic MCI (aMCI) patients in comparison 
with healthy control group (CogN).
METHODS: 30 aMCI patients and 23 CogN group, matched by age and education, 
underwent equal neuropsychological assessment and EEG recording, according to 
the same protocol.
RESULTS: qEEG spectral analysis revealed decrease of global relative beta band 
power and increase of global relative theta and delta power in aMCI patients. 
Whereas, decreased coherence in centroparietal right area considered to be an 
early qEEG biomarker of functional disconnection of the brain network in aMCI 
patients. In conclusion, the demonstrated changes in qEEG, especially, the 
coherence patterns are specific biomarkers of cognitive impairment in aMCI.
CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, qEEG measurements appears to be a useful tool that 
complements neuropsychological diagnostics, assessing the risk of progression 
and provides a basis for possible interventions designed to improve cognitive 
functions or even inhibit the progression of the disease.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an environmental toxicant of significant health 
concern. The brain is a major target in acute H2S poisoning. This study was 
conducted to test the hypothesis that acute and subchronic ambient H2S exposures 
alter the brain metabolome. Male 7-8-week-old C57BL/6J mice were exposed by 
whole-body inhalation to 1000 ppm H2S for 45 min and euthanized at 5 min or 72 h 
for acute exposure. For subchronic study, mice were exposed to 5 ppm H2S 2 
h/day, 5 days/week for 5 weeks. Control mice were exposed to room air. The 
brainstem was removed for metabolomic analysis. Enrichment analysis showed that 
the metabolomic profiles in acute and subchronic H2S exposures matched with 
those of cerebral spinal fluid from patients with seizures or Alzheimer's 
disease. Acute H2S exposure decreased excitatory neurotransmitters, aspartate, 
and glutamate, while the inhibitory neurotransmitter, serotonin, was increased. 
Branched-chain amino acids and glucose were increased by acute H2S exposure. 
Subchronic H2S exposure within OSHA guidelines surprisingly decreased serotonin 
concentration. In subchronic H2S exposure, glucose was decreased, while 
polyunsaturated fatty acids, inosine, and hypoxanthine were increased. 
Collectively, these results provide important mechanistic clues for acute and 
subchronic ambient H2S poisoning and show that H2S alters brainstem metabolome.

INTRODUCTION: Establishing valid diagnostic strategies is a precondition for 
successful therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: One hundred forty-four healthy 75-year-old participants from the 
Vienna-Transdanube-Aging longitudinal cohort study were tested for neuroaxonal 
damage by single molecular array (Simoa) plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) 
levels at baseline, 30, 60, and 90 months, and onset of AD dementia. Individual 
risk for sporadic AD was estimated by continuous shrinkage polygenic risk score 
(PRS-CS, genome-wide association study).
RESULTS: Nineteen participants developed AD after a median of 60 months 
(interquartile range 30). In participants with AD, baseline NfL plasma levels 
correlated with PRS-CS (r = 0.75, p < 0.001; difference to controls: Fisher's 
r-to-z: z = 3.89, p < 0.001). PRS-CS combined with baseline plasma NfL predicted 
onset of AD (p < 0.01).
DISCUSSION: Our data suggest that polygenic risk for AD and plasma NfL closely 
interact years before onset of clinical symptoms. Peripheral NfL may serve as a 
diagnostic measure supporting early therapeutic intervention and secondary 
prevention in AD.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and cognitive training for 
patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) can change functional connectivity (FC) 
within gray matter (GM). However, the role of white matter (WM) and changes of 
GM-WM FC under these therapies are still unclear. To clarify this problem, we 
applied 40 Hz rTMS over angular gyrus (AG) concurrent with cognitive training to 
15 mild-moderate AD patients and analyzed the resting-state functional magnetic 
resonance imaging before and after treatment. Through AG-based FC analysis, 
corona radiata and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) were identified as 
activated WM tracts. Compared with the GM results with AG as seed, more GM 
regions were found with activated WM tracts as seeds. The averaged FC, 
fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF), and regional 
homogeneity (ReHo) of the above GM regions had stronger clinical correlations 
(r/P = 0.363/0.048 vs 0.299/0.108, 0.351/0.057 vs 0.267/0.153, 0.420/0.021 vs 
0.408/0.025, for FC/fALFF/ReHo, respectively) and better classification 
performance to distinguish pre-/post-treatment groups (AUC = 0.91 vs 0.88, 0.65 
vs 0.63, 0.87 vs 0.82, for FC/fALFF/ReHo, respectively). Our results indicated 
that rTMS concurrent with cognitive training could rewire brain network by 
enhancing GM-WM FC in AD, and corona radiata and SLF played an important role in 
this process.

Pu-zhi-hui-ling decoction (PZHLD) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) 
formula for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its chemical 
composition has not been reported. In this study, we aimed to establish a mass 
spectrometry (MS) analysis method for rapid classification and identification of 
the chemical constituents in PZHLD. The sample was analysed by 
ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole Orbitrap 
high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS). The chemical 
constituents of PZHLD were identified based on accurate MS data, fragmentation 
characteristics of MS/MS, and reference information described in the literature. 
A total of 123 chemical constituents were identified. In addition, we summarised 
the fragmentation pathways of the chemical constituents in PZHLD. Our finding 
might lay the foundation for the further pharmacodynamic study and clinical 
application of PZHLD.

Hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9orf72 is one of the most common causes of 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. The hexanucleotide 
expansion, formed by GGGGCC (G4C2) repeats, leads to the production of five 
dipeptide protein repeats (DPRs) via repeat-associated non-AUG translation. 
Among the five dipeptide repeats, Gly-Arg, Pro-Arg, and Gly-Ala form neuronal 
inclusions that contain aggregates of the peptides. Several studies have 
attempted to model DPR-associated toxicity using various repeat lengths, which 
suggests a unique conformation that is cytotoxic and is independent of the 
repeat length. However, the structural characteristics of DPR aggregates have 
yet to be determined. Increasing evidence suggests that soluble species, such as 
oligomers, are the main cause of toxicity in proteinopathies, such as 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. To investigate the ability of DPRs to 
aggregate and form toxic oligomers, we adopted a reductionist approach using 
small dipeptide repeats of 3, 6, and 12. This study shows that DPRs, 
particularly glycine-arginine and proline-arginine, form oligomers that exhibit 
distinct dye-binding properties and morphologies. Importantly, we also 
identified toxic DPR oligomers in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 
frontotemporal dementia postmortem brains that are morphologically similar to 
those generated recombinantly. This study demonstrates that, similar to soluble 
oligomers formed by various amyloid proteins, DPR oligomers are toxic, 
independent of their repeat length.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a gradual decline in cognitive 
function and memory impairment, significantly impacting the daily lives of 
patients. Rivastigmine (RHT), a cholinesterase inhibitor, is used to treat mild 
to moderate AD via oral administration. However, oral administration is 
associated with slow absorption rate and severe systemic side effects. RHT nasal 
spray (RHT-ns), as a nose-to-brain delivery system, is more promising for AD 
management due to its efficient brain delivery and reduced peripheral exposure. 
This study constructed RHT-ns for enhancing AD treatment efficacy, and meanwhile 
the correlation between drug olfactory deposition and drug entering into the 
brain was explored. A 3D-printed nasal cast was employed to quantify the drug 
olfactory deposition. Brain delivery of RHT-ns was quantified using fluorescence 
tracking and Desorption Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (DESI-MS) 
analysis, which showed a good correlation to the olfactory deposition. F2 
(containing 1% (w/v) viscosity modifier Avicel® RC-591) with high olfactory 
deposition and drug brain delivery was further investigated for pharmacodynamics 
study. F2 exhibited superiority in AD treatment over the commercially available 
oral formulation. In summary, the present study showed the successful 
development of RHT-ns with improved olfactory deposition and enhanced brain 
delivery. It might provide new insight into the design and development of 
nose-to-brain systems for the treatment of AD.

Update of
    ArXiv. 2023 Oct 27;:

Recently, drug repurposing has emerged as an effective and resource-efficient 
paradigm for AD drug discovery. Among various methods for drug repurposing, 
network-based methods have shown promising results as they are capable of 
leveraging complex networks that integrate multiple interaction types, such as 
protein-protein interactions, to more effectively identify candidate drugs. 
However, existing approaches typically assume paths of the same length in the 
network have equal importance in identifying the therapeutic effect of drugs. 
Other domains have found that same length paths do not necessarily have the same 
importance. Thus, relying on this assumption may be deleterious to drug 
repurposing attempts. In this work, we propose MPI (Modeling Path Importance), a 
novel network-based method for AD drug repurposing. MPI is unique in that it 
prioritizes important paths via learned node embeddings, which can effectively 
capture a network's rich structural information. Thus, leveraging learned 
embeddings allows MPI to effectively differentiate the importance among paths. 
We evaluate MPI against a commonly used baseline method that identifies anti-AD 
drug candidates primarily based on the shortest paths between drugs and AD in 
the network. We observe that among the top-50 ranked drugs, MPI prioritizes 
20.0% more drugs with anti-AD evidence compared to the baseline. Finally, Cox 
proportional-hazard models produced from insurance claims data aid us in 
identifying the use of etodolac, nicotine, and BBB-crossing ACE-INHs as having a 
reduced risk of AD, suggesting such drugs may be viable candidates for 
repurposing and should be explored further in future studies.

A recent study by Ding et al. explores the integration of artificial 
intelligence (AI) in predicting dementia risk over a 10-year period using a 
multimodal approach. While revealing the potential of machine learning models in 
identifying high-risk individuals through neuropsychological testing, MRI 
imaging, and clinical risk factors, the imperative of dynamic frailty assessment 
emerges for accurate late-life dementia prediction. The commentary highlights 
challenges associated with AI models, including dimensionality and data 
standardization, emphasizing the critical need for a dynamic, comprehensive 
approach to reflect the evolving nature of dementia and improve predictive 
accuracy.

7-Ketocholesterol and 7β-hydroxycholesterol are most often derived from the 
autoxidation of cholesterol. Their quantities are often increased in the body 
fluids and/or diseased organs of patients with age-related diseases such as 
cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer's disease, age-related macular degeneration, 
and sarcopenia which are frequently associated with a rupture of RedOx 
homeostasis leading to a high oxidative stress contributing to cell and tissue 
damages. On murine cells from the central nervous system (158N oligodendrocytes, 
microglial BV-2 cells, and neuronal N2a cells) as well as on C2C12 murine 
myoblasts, these two oxysterols can induce a mode of cell death which is 
associated with qualitative, quantitative, and functional modifications of the 
peroxisome. These changes can be revealed by fluorescence microscopy (apotome, 
confocal microscopy), transmission electron microscopy, flow cytometry, 
quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and gas 
chromatography-coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Noteworthy, several 
natural molecules, including ω3 fatty acids, polyphenols, and α-tocopherol, as 
well as several Mediterranean oils [argan and olive oils, Milk-thistle (Sylibum 
marianum) and Pistacia lenticus seed oils], have cytoprotective properties and 
attenuate 7-ketocholesterol- and 7β-hydroxycholesterol-induced peroxisomal 
modifications. These observations led to the concept of pexotherapy.

Protein kinase-B (Akt) and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling 
pathways are implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Akt/mTOR 
signaling pathways, activated by external inputs, enable new protein synthesis 
at the synapse and synaptic plasticity. The molecular mechanisms impeding new 
protein synthesis at the synapse in AD pathogenesis remain elusive. Here, we 
aimed to understand the molecular mechanisms prior to the manifestation of 
histopathological hallmarks by characterizing Akt1/mTOR signaling cascades and 
new protein synthesis in the hippocampus of WT and amyloid precursor 
protein/presenilin-1 (APP/PS1) male mice. Intriguingly, compared to those in WT 
mice, we found significant decreases in pAkt1, pGSK3β, pmTOR, pS6 ribosomal 
protein, and p4E-BP1 levels in both post nuclear supernatant and synaptosomes 
isolated from the hippocampus of one-month-old (presymptomatic) APP/PS1 mice. In 
synaptoneurosomes prepared from the hippocampus of presymptomatic APP/PS1 mice, 
activity-dependent protein synthesis at the synapse was impaired and this 
deficit was sustained in young adults. In hippocampal neurons from C57BL/6 mice, 
downregulation of Akt1 precluded synaptic activity-dependent protein synthesis 
at the dendrites but not in the soma. In three-month-old APP/PS1 mice, Akt 
activator (SC79) administration restored deficits in memory recall and 
activity-dependent synaptic protein synthesis. C57BL/6 mice administered with an 
Akt inhibitor (MK2206) resulted in memory recall deficits compared to those 
treated with vehicle. We conclude that dysregulation of Akt1/mTOR and its 
downstream signaling molecules in the hippocampus contribute to memory recall 
deficits and loss of activity-dependent synaptic protein synthesis. In AD mice, 
however, Akt activation ameliorates deficits in memory recall and 
activity-dependent synaptic protein synthesis.

Physalis alkekengi L. var. franchetii (Mast.) Makino (PA), a traditional Chinese 
medicine, is utilised for treating dermatitis, sore throat, dysuria, and cough. 
This research aimed to identify the main constituents in the four extracted 
portions from the calyces of PA (PAC) utilising ultra-performance liquid 
chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry 
(UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). The Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice model was induced by 
D-galactose (D-gal) combined with aluminium chloride (AlCl3). Subsequent 
investigation into the underlying mechanisms involved behavioural and 
histopathological observations. The results demonstrated that four extracted 
portions of PAC (PACE) significantly enhanced memory and learning abilities in 
the Morris water maze. The concentrations of Aβ, tau and p-tau in brain tissue 
exhibited a significant decrease relative to the model group. Moreover, the four 
PACE treatment groups increased the glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase 
(SOD) levels, while concurrently reducing malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin-1β 
(IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels. In 
summary, the current study demonstrates that the four PACE formulations exhibit 
beneficial anti-AD properties, with the most pronounced efficacy observed in the 
EA group. Additionally, PAC shows potential in mitigating neuroinflammation and 
oxidative damage by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-κB signalling pathway. This research 
lays a theoretical groundwork for the future clinical development and 
utilisation of PAC in treating AD.

BACKGROUND: The associations between neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) and 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been well-studied, yet gaps remain.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the associations of four subsyndromes 
(hyperactivity, psychosis, affective symptoms, and apathy) of NPSs with 
cognition, neurodegeneration, and AD pathologies.
METHODS: Totally 1,040 non-demented elderly (48.07% males) from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were included. We assessed the 
relationships between NPSs and AD neuropathologies, cognition, 
neurodegeneration, and clinical correlates in cross-sectional and longitudinal 
via multiple linear regression, linear mixed effects, and Cox proportional 
hazard models. Causal mediation analyses were conducted to explore the mediation 
effects of AD pathologies on cognition and neurodegeneration.
RESULTS: We found that individuals with hyperactivity, psychosis, affective 
symptoms, or apathy displayed a poorer cognitive status, a lower CSF amyloid-β 
(Aβ) level and a higher risk of clinical conversion (p < 0.05). Hyperactivity 
and affective symptoms were associated with increasing cerebral Aβ deposition 
(p < 0.05). Except psychosis, the other three subsyndromes accompanied with 
faster atrophy of hippocampal volume (p < 0.05). Specific NPSs were 
predominantly associated with different cognitive domains decline through an 
8-year follow-up (p < 0.05). Moreover, the relationships between NPSs and 
cognitive decline, neurodegeneration might be associated with Aβ, the mediation 
percentage varied from 6.05% to 17.51% (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: NPSs could be strongly associated with AD. The influences of NPSs 
on cognitive impairments, neurodegeneration might be partially associated with 
Aβ.

The article examines the potential role of brain mechanical damage as a trigger 
for the development of neurodegenerative changes. Attention is paid to 
dysfunction of the neurovascular unit, and disruption of the functional and 
compensatory capabilities of blood flow. The importance of microhemorrhages that 
occur in the acute period of injury and the formation of first focal and then 
diffuse neuroinflammation is emphasized. The importance of mitochondrial 
dysfunction was separately determined as a significant factor in increasing the 
risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) in patients after traumatic brain 
injury (TBI). In TBI, there is a decrease in the expression of tight junction 
(TC) proteins of endothelial cells, such as occludin, claudin, JP, which leads 
to increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier. TBI, provoking endothelial 
dysfunction, contributes to the development of metabolic disorders of β-amyloid 
and tau protein, which in turn leads to worsening vascular damage, resulting in 
a vicious circle that can ultimately lead to the development of AD and dementia. 
Age-related changes in cerebral arteries, which impair perivascular transport of 
interstitial fluid, are currently considered as an important part of the 
«amyloid cascade», especially against the background of genetically mediated 
disorders of glial membranes associated with defective aquaporin-4 (encoded by 
the APOE4). Studies in animal models of TBI have revealed an increase in tau 
protein immunoreactivity and its phosphorylation, which correlates with the 
severity of injury. A comprehensive analysis of research results shows that the 
cascade of reactions triggered by TBI includes all the main elements of the 
pathogenesis of AD: disorders of energy metabolism, microcirculation and 
clearance of cerebral metabolic products. This leads to a disruption in the 
metabolism of amyloid protein and its accumulation in brain tissue with the 
subsequent development of tauopathy. Cerebrolysin, by modulating the 
permeability of the blood-brain barrier, blocks the development of 
neuroinflammation, reduces the accumulation of pathological forms of proteins 
and may be slow down the progression of neurodegeneration.

Publisher: В статье рассматривается роль травматического повреждения головного 
мозга как триггера развития нейродегенеративных изменений. Уделено внимание 
дисфункции нейроваскулярной единицы и нарушению функциональных и компенсаторных 
возможностей кровотока. Подчеркивается значение микрокровоизлияний в остром 
периоде черепно-мозговой травмы (ЧМТ) и формирования нейровоспаления. Отмечена 
роль митохондриальной дисфункции в повышении риска развития болезни Альцгеймера 
(БА) у пациентов, перенесших ЧМТ. Снижение экспрессии белков плотных контактов 
приводит к повышению проницаемости гематоэнцефалического барьера (ГЭБ). ЧМТ, 
провоцируя эндотелиальную дисфункцию, способствует нарушению обмена β-амилоида и 
тау-протеина, усугублению сосудистого поражения, вследствие чего возникает 
порочный круг, способный вести к развитию БА и деменции. Изменения церебральных 
артерий, ухудшающие транспорт интерстициальной жидкости, рассматриваются как 
важная часть «амилоидного каскада» на фоне генетически опосредованных нарушений 
глиальных мембран, связанных с дефектом аквапорина-4. Каскад реакций, 
запускаемый ЧМТ, включает в себя все основные элементы патогенеза БА: нарушения 
энергетического обмена, микроциркуляции и клиренса продуктов обмена, что 
приводит к накоплению амилоидного белка в головном мозге с последующим развитием 
таупатии. Церебролизин, модулируя проницаемость ГЭБ, блокирует развитие 
нейровоспаления, уменьшает накопление патологических форм белков, способен 
замедлить прогрессирование нейродегенерации.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal and incurable disease involving 
motor neuron (MN) degeneration and is characterized by ongoing myasthenia and 
amyotrophia in adults. Most ALS patients die of respiratory muscle paralysis 
after an average of 3-5 years. Defective autophagy in MNs is considered an 
important trigger of ALS pathogenesis. Roflupram (ROF) was demonstrated to 
activate autophagy in microglial cells and exert protective effects against 
Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, our research 
aimed to investigate the efficacy and mechanism of ROF in treating ALS both in 
vivo and in vitro. We found that ROF could delay disease onset and prolong the 
survival of hSOD1-G93A transgenic mice. Moreover, ROF protected MNs in the 
anterior horn of the spinal cord, activated the AMPK/ULK1 signaling pathway, 
increased autophagic flow, and reduced SOD1 aggregation. In an NSC34 cell line 
stably transfected with hSOD1-G93A, ROF protected against cellular damage caused 
by hSOD1-G93A. Moreover, we have demonstrated that ROF inhibited gliosis in ALS 
model mice. Collectively, our study suggested that ROF is neuroprotective in ALS 
models and the AMPK/ULK1 signaling pathway is a potential therapeutic target in 
ALS, which increases autophagic flow and reduces SOD1 aggregation.

OBJECTIVE: The use of blood-based biomarkers of Alzheimer disease (AD) may 
facilitate access to biomarker testing of groups that have been historically 
under-represented in research. We evaluated whether plasma Aβ42/40 has similar 
or different baseline levels and longitudinal rates of change in participants 
racialized as Black or White.
METHODS: The Study of Race to Understand Alzheimer Biomarkers (SORTOUT-AB) is a 
multi-center longitudinal study to evaluate for potential differences in AD 
biomarkers between individuals racialized as Black or White. Plasma samples 
collected at three AD Research Centers (Washington University, University of 
Pennsylvania, and University of Alabama-Birmingham) underwent analysis with C2N 
Diagnostics' PrecivityAD™ blood test for Aβ42 and Aβ40. General linear mixed 
effects models were used to estimate the baseline levels and rates of 
longitudinal change for plasma Aβ measures in both racial groups. Analyses also 
examined whether dementia status, age, sex, education, APOE ε4 carrier status, 
medical comorbidities, or fasting status modified potential racial differences.
RESULTS: Of the 324 Black and 1,547 White participants, there were 158 Black and 
759 White participants with plasma Aβ measures from at least two longitudinal 
samples over a mean interval of 6.62 years. At baseline, the group of Black 
participants had lower levels of plasma Aβ40 but similar levels of plasma Aβ42 
as compared to the group of White participants. As a result, baseline plasma 
Aβ42/40 levels were higher in the Black group than the White group, consistent 
with the Black group having lower levels of amyloid pathology. Racial 
differences in plasma Aβ42/40 were not modified by age, sex, education, APOE ε4 
carrier status, medical conditions (hypertension and diabetes), or fasting 
status. Despite differences in baseline levels, the Black and White groups had a 
similar longitudinal rate of change in plasma Aβ42/40.
INTERPRETATION: Black individuals participating in AD research studies had a 
higher mean level of plasma Aβ42/40, consistent with a lower level of amyloid 
pathology, which, if confirmed, may imply a lower proportion of Black 
individuals being eligible for AD clinical trials in which the presence of 
amyloid is a prerequisite. However, there was no significant racial difference 
in the rate of change in plasma Aβ42/40, suggesting that amyloid pathology 
accumulates similarly across racialized groups.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), 
especially for those with multidomain cognitive deficits, should be clinically 
examined for determining risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. 
English-speakers with aMCI exhibit language impairments mostly at the 
lexical-semantic level. Given that the language processing of Mandarin Chinese 
is different from that of alphabetic languages, whether previous findings for 
English-speakers with aMCI can be generalized to Mandarin Chinese speakers with 
aMCI remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study examined the multifaceted language functions of Mandarin 
Chinese speakers with aMCI and compared them with those without cognitive 
impairment by using a newly developed language test battery.
METHODS: Twenty-three individuals with aMCI and 29 individuals without cognitive 
impairment were recruited. The new language test battery comprises five language 
domains (oral production, auditory and reading comprehension, reading aloud, 
repetition, and writing).
RESULTS: Compared with the controls, the individuals with aMCI exhibited poorer 
performance in the oral production and auditory and reading comprehension 
domains, especially on tests involving effortful lexical and semantic 
processing. Moreover, the aMCI group made more semantic naming errors compared 
with their counterparts and tended to experience difficulty in processing items 
belonging to the categories of living objects.
CONCLUSIONS: The pattern identified in the present study is similar to that of 
English-speaking individuals with aMCI across multiple language domains. 
Incorporating language tests involving lexical and semantic processing into 
clinical practice is essential and can help identify early language dysfunction 
in Mandarin Chinese speakers with aMCI.

First-degree relatives of Alzheimer's disease patients constitute a key 
population in the search for early markers. Our group identified functional 
connectivity differences between cognitively unimpaired individuals with and 
without a family history. In this unprecedented follow-up study, we examine 
whether family history is associated with a longitudinal increase in the 
functional connectivity of those regions. Moreover, this is the first work to 
correlate electrophysiological measures with plasma p-tau231 levels, a known 
pathology marker, to interpret the nature of the change. We evaluated 69 
cognitively unimpaired individuals with a family history of Alzheimer's disease 
and 28 without, at two different time points, approximately 3 years apart, 
including resting state magnetoencephalography recordings and plasma p-tau231 
determinations. Functional connectivity changes in both precunei and left 
anterior cingulate cortex in the high-alpha band were studied using 
non-parametric cluster-based permutation tests. Connectivity values were 
correlated with p-tau231 levels. Three clusters emerged in individuals with 
family history, exhibiting a longitudinal increase of connectivity. Notably, the 
clusters for both precunei bore a striking resemblance to those found in 
previous cross-sectional studies. The connectivity values at follow-up and the 
change in connectivity in the left precuneus cluster showed significant positive 
correlations with p-tau231. This study consolidates the use of 
electrophysiology, in combination with plasma biomarkers, to monitor healthy 
individuals at risk of Alzheimer's disease and emphasizes the value of combining 
noninvasive markers to understand the underlying mechanisms and track disease 
progression. This could facilitate the design of more effective intervention 
strategies and accurate progression assessment tools.

The escalating prevalence of metabolic diseases and an aging demographic has 
been correlated with a concerning rise in Alzheimer's disease (AD) incidence. 
This study aimed to access the protective effects of curcumin, a bioactive 
flavonoid from turmeric, on spatial memory, metabolic functions, and the 
regulation of the gut microbiome in AD-induced (3xTg-AD) mice fed with either a 
normal chow diet (NCD) or a high-fat high-sugar diet (HFHSD). Our findings 
revealed an augmented susceptibility of the HFHSD-fed 3xTg-AD mice for weight 
gain and memory impairment, while curcumin supplementation demonstrated a 
protective effect against these changes. This was evidenced by significantly 
reduced body weight gain and improved behavioral and cognitive function in the 
curcumin-treated group. These improvements were substantiated by diminished 
fatty acid synthesis, altered cholesterol metabolism, and suppressed 
adipogenesis-related pathways in the liver, along with modified synaptic 
plasticity-related pathways in the brain. Moreover, curcumin enriched beneficial 
gut microbiota, including Oscillospiraceae and Rikenellaceae at the family 
level, and Oscillibacter, Alistipes, Pseudoflavonifractor, Duncaniella, and 
Flintibacter at the genus level. The observed alteration in these gut microbiota 
profiles suggests a potential crosswalk in the liver and brain for regulating 
metabolic and cognitive functions, particularly in the context of 
obesity-associated cognitive disfunction, notably AD.

BACKGROUND: Existing measures of scam susceptibility lack ecological validity 
and situational variability. Evidence suggests that all adults may be 
susceptible to scams, though a comprehensive fraud victimization theory remains 
to be explored.
OBJECTIVE: To identify cognitive and sociodemographic variables that 
differentiate individuals with high scam susceptibility from those less 
susceptible. This article describes the development and feasibility of the 
Assessment of Situational Judgment questionnaire (ASJ), a brief tool designed to 
detect scam susceptibility.
METHODS: The 17-item ASJ was developed using a combination of existing scams 
reported by the Florida Division of Consumer Services and legitimate scenarios. 
Participants were presented with scam and legitimate scenarios and queried 
regarding their willingness to engage. Response options were offered with 
instructions on a 7-point Likert scale (extremely unlikely to extremely likely). 
Pilot data from a development sample provided the foundation for the final 
version of the ASJ.
RESULTS: The final version of the ASJ was administered to 183 online 
participants. The Scam factor (8 items) explained 50.6% of the variance. The 
Legit factor (9 items) reported on a 7-point Likert scale explaining 10.6% of 
the variance. A Scam to Legit ratio provides a proxy for overall scam 
susceptibility. Cut-off scores of 24 on the Scam factor, 47 on the Legit factor, 
and 0.62 on the ratio optimize measures of scam susceptibility.
CONCLUSIONS: The ASJ is a brief, ecologically valid measure of scam 
susceptibility. There is a need for a sensitive and specific tool to detect scam 
susceptibility in clinical, community, and financial settings.

BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been linked to multiple 
pathophysiological processes that could increase risk for Alzheimer's disease 
and related dementias (ADRD). However, the impact of prior TBI on blood 
biomarkers for ADRD remains unknown.
OBJECTIVE: Using cross-sectional data, we assessed whether a history of TBI 
influences serum biomarkers in a diverse cohort (approximately 50% Hispanic) 
with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, or dementia.
METHODS: Levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light 
(NFL), total tau (T-tau), and ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCHL1) 
were measured for participants across the cognitive spectrum. Participants were 
categorized based on presence and absence of a history of TBI with loss of 
consciousness, and study samples were derived through case-control matching. 
Multivariable general linear models compared concentrations of biomarkers in 
relation to a history of TBI and smoothing splines modelled biomarkers 
non-linearly in the cognitively impaired groups as a function of time since 
symptom onset.
RESULTS: Each biomarker was higher across stages of cognitive impairment, 
characterized by clinical diagnosis and Mini-Mental State Examination 
performance, but these associations were not influenced by a history of TBI. 
However, modelling biomarkers in relation to duration of cognitive symptoms for 
ADRD showed differences by history of TBI, with only GFAP and UCHL1 being 
elevated.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum GFAP, NFL, T-tau, and UCHL1 were higher across stages of 
cognitive impairment in this diverse clinical cohort, regardless of TBI history, 
though longitudinal investigation of the timing, order, and trajectory of the 
biomarkers in relation to prior TBI is warranted.

BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are a common aspect of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Multiple studies have investigated its brain correlates, but it 
still remains unclear how they relate with brain atrophy in mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI).
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to investigate brain volume in MCI patients as a 
function of NPS.
METHODS: We measured grey matter volume, neuropsychological status and NPS 
(Neuropsychiatric Inventory, NPI), in a sample of 81 MCI patients (43 females). 
Participants were divided in groups depending on presence (NPS+) or absence 
(NPS-) of NPS and on type of NPS.
RESULTS: We found lower volume of left temporal pole in patients with depression 
compared to NPS- (p = 0.012), and in patients with agitation compared to NPS- in 
the right middle occipital gyrus (p = 0.003). We also found a significant 
correlation between volume of left temporal pole and MMSE (r (78)  = 0.232, 
p = 0.019). Finally, NPS+ presented lower cross-sectional cognitive level than 
NPS- (t (79)  = 1.79, p = 0.038), and faster cognitive decline (t (48)  = -1.74, 
p = 0.044).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the colocalization of structural damage as a 
possible mechanism underlying the relationship between MCI and depression and 
provide novel evidence regarding agitation. Moreover, our longitudinal evidence 
highlights the relevance of an adequate identification of NPS in MCI patients to 
identify those at risk of faster cognitive decline.

As the emerging treatments that target grey matter pathology in Alzheimer's 
Disease have limited effectiveness, there is a critical need to identify new 
neural targets for treatments. White matter's (WM) metabolic vulnerability makes 
it a promising candidate for new interventions. This study examined the age and 
sex differences in estimates of axonal content, as well the associations of with 
highly prevalent modifiable health risk factors such as metabolic syndrome and 
adiposity. We estimated intra-axonal volume fraction (ICVF) using the Neurite 
Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) in a sample of 89 cognitively 
and neurologically healthy adults (20-79 years). We showed that ICVF correlated 
positively with age and estimates of myelin content. The ICVF was also lower in 
women than men, across all ages, which difference was accounted for by 
intracranial volume. Finally, we found no association of metabolic risk or 
adiposity scores with the current estimates of ICVF. In addition, the previously 
observed adiposity-myelin associations (Burzynska et al., 2023) were independent 
of ICVF. Although our findings confirm the vulnerability of axons to aging, they 
suggest that metabolic dysfunction may selectively affect myelin content, at 
least in cognitively and neurologically healthy adults with low metabolic risk, 
and when using the specific MRI techniques. Future studies need to revisit our 
findings using larger samples and different MRI approaches, and identify 
modifiable factors that accelerate axonal deterioration as well as mechanisms 
linking peripheral metabolism with the health of myelin.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Glioma is often refractory. The accumulation of amyloid beta 
(Aβ) in the brain is commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), but 
there are studies suggesting that Aβ has tumor suppressor potential. The aim of 
this study was to identify a novel, non-invasive candidate biomarker for 
histological prediction and prognostic assessment of glioma.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum was prepared from blood samples collected 
preoperatively from 48 patients with WHO grade II-IV glioma between October 2004 
and December 2017 at a single tertiary institution. The concentration of Aβ42 
was measured using the SMCxPRO immunoassay (Merck). The clinical and 
histological characteristics of the patients, including molecular subtypes, were 
reviewed.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 52.2±12.5 years. The mean value of 
serum Aβ42 concentration was 7.6±7.8 pg/ml in the anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO 
grade III) group and 6.4±6.5 pg/ml in the glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade IV) 
group. The Negative epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression was 
associated with higher serum Aβ42 levels (p=0.020). Kaplan-Meier analysis 
demonstrated that patients with high serum Aβ42 (>11.78 pg/ml) had significantly 
longer progression-free survival (PFS) (p=0.038) and overall survival (OS) 
(p=0.018).
CONCLUSION: This study investigated serum Aβ42 levels as a potential biomarker 
for glioma. The results showed that low serum Aβ42 levels were associated with 
EGFR expression and poor PFS and OS. Overall, these findings suggest a potential 
role of Aβ42 as a prognostic marker in astrocytomas.

BACKGROUND: Existing evidence points to substantial gaps in detecting mild 
cognitive impairment in primary care but is based on limited or self-reported 
data. The recent emergence of disease-modifying treatments for the Alzheimer's 
disease, the most common etiology of mild cognitive impairment, calls for a 
systematic assessment of detection rates in primary care.
OBJECTIVES: The current study aims to examine detection rates for mild cognitive 
impairment among primary care clinicians and practices in the United States 
using Medicare claims and encounter data.
DESIGN: Observational study.
SETTING: Medicare administrative data.
PARTICIPANTS: The study sample includes a total of 226,756 primary care 
clinicians and 54,597 practices that had at least 25 patients aged 65 or older, 
who were enrolled in Medicare fee-for-service or a Medicare Advantage plan 
between 2017 and 2019.
MEASUREMENTS: The detection rate for mild cognitive impairment is assessed as 
the ratio between the observed diagnosis rate of a clinician or practice as 
documented in the data, and the expected rate based on a predictive model.
RESULTS: The average detection rates for mild cognitive impairment is 0.08 
(interquartile range=0.00-0.02) for both clinicians and practices, suggesting 
that only about 8% of expected cases were diagnosed on average. Only 0.1% of 
clinicians and practices had diagnosis rates within the expected range.
CONCLUSIONS: Mild cognitive impairment is vastly underdiagnosed, pointing to an 
urgent need to improve early detection in primary care.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the content of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides Aβ40, Aβ42, total 
and threonine phosphorylated 181 tau-protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 
patients with the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was performed on 64 patients with a diagnosis of 
dementia and MMSE scores of 24 or lower. All patients underwent lumbar puncture. 
Aβ40, Aβ42, Aβ42/40 ratio, total tau, phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 were 
determined in the CSF using a multiplex assay according to the manufacturer's 
protocol, the concentration was determined in pkg/ml.
RESULTS: The preliminary diagnosis of AD was made in 3 patients (5%). As a 
result of the study of protein content in the CSF, signs of AD were detected in 
48 (75%) people. The findings suggest that the diagnosis of AD is made 10-14 
times less frequently than it should be according to the World Health 
Organization data. The discrepancy between clinical diagnosis and laboratory 
findings is confirmed by our study.
CONCLUSION: Differences in the therapy of dementias and the development of new 
drugs targeting specific links in the pathogenesis of different types of 
dementias require accurate and complete diagnosis of dementias, especially AD, 
as the most common type of dementia.

Publisher: ЦЕЛЬ ИССЛЕДОВАНИЯ: Сопоставление содержания Aβ40, Aβ42, общего и 
фосфорилированного по треонину 181 тау-белка (Tau) в цереброспинальной жидкости 
(ЦСЖ) с клиническим диагнозом болезни Альцгеймера (БА).
МАТЕРИАЛ И МЕТОДЫ: Исследование проведено на 64 пациентах с диагнозом «деменция» 
и оценкой по краткой шкале оценки психического статуса (MMSE) от 24 баллов и 
ниже. Всем пациентам выполнялась люмбальная пункция. Aβ40, Aβ42, соотношение 
Aβ42/40, общий Tau, фосфорилированный Tau по треонину 181 определяли в ЦСЖ при 
помощи мультиплексного анализа по протоколу производителя, концентрацию 
определяли в пкг/мл.
РЕЗУЛЬТАТЫ: Предварительный клинический диагноз БА был поставлен только 3 (5%) 
пациентам. В результате исследования обнаружено повышенное содержание 
патологических белков в ЦСЖ, характерных для БА, у 48 (75%) человек. Полученные 
данные говорят о том, что диагноз БА ставят в 10—14 раз реже, чем показывает 
общемировая статистика. Несоответствие клинического диагноза с данными 
лабораторных исследований подтверждается нашим исследованием.
ЗАКЛЮЧЕНИЕ: Различия в терапии деменций и разработка новых препаратов, 
направленных на специфические звенья патогенеза разного вида деменций, требуют 
точной и полной диагностики деменций, особенно БА как наиболее часто 
встречающегося типа данного заболевания.

Cognitive functions produced by large-scale neural integrations are the most 
representative 'emergence phenomena' in complex systems. A novel approach 
focusing on the instantaneous phase difference of brain oscillations across 
brain regions has succeeded in detecting moment-to-moment dynamic functional 
connectivity. However, it is restricted to pairwise observations of two brain 
regions, contrary to large-scale spatial neural integration in the whole-brain. 
In this study, we introduce a microstate analysis to capture whole-brain 
instantaneous phase distributions instead of pairwise differences. Upon applying 
this method to electroencephalography signals of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which 
is characterised by progressive cognitive decline, the AD-specific state 
transition among the four states defined as the leading phase location due to 
the loss of brain regional interactions could be promptly characterised. In 
conclusion, our synthetic analysis approach, focusing on the microstate and 
instantaneous phase, enables the capture of the instantaneous spatiotemporal 
neural dynamics of brain activity and characterises its pathological conditions.

BACKGROUND: Although the concordance between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers and amyloid-PET findings is well known, 
there are no data regarding the concordance of amyloid-PET with inconclusive CSF 
values of amyloid-β (Aβ)1 - 42 and p-tau for the diagnosis of AD.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the amyloid-PET results with 
discordant AD biomarkers values in CSF (Aβ1 - 42+/p-tau-or Aβ1 - 42-/p-tau+).
METHODS: An observational retrospective study, including 62 patients with mild 
cognitive impairment (32/62) or dementia (30/62), suspicious of AD who had 
undergone a lumbar puncture to determine CSF AD biomarkers, and presented 
discordant values in CSF between Aβ1 - 42 and p-tau (Aβ1 - 42+/p-tau-or 
Aβ1 - 42-/p-tau+). All of them, underwent an amyloid-PET with 18F-Florbetaben. 
An extensive neuropsychological testing as part of their diagnostic process 
(MMSE and TMA-93), was performed, and it was also obtained the Global 
Deterioration Scale.
RESULTS: Comparing the discordant CSF results of each patient with the cerebral 
amyloid-PET results, we found that in the group with Aβ1 - 42+ and p-tau-CSF 
values, the amyloid-PET was positive in 51.2% and negative in 48.8% of patients, 
while in the group with Aβ1 - 42-and p-Tau+ CSF values, the amyloid-PET was 
positive in 52.6% of patients and negative in 47.4% of them. No significant 
association was found (p = 0.951) between the results of amyloid-PET and the two 
divergent groups in CSF.
CONCLUSIONS: No significant relationship was observed between the results of 
discordant AD biomarkers in CSF and the result of amyloid-PET. No trend in 
amyloid-PET results was observed in relation to CSF biomarker values.

Demographic changes will expand the number of senior citizens suffering from 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Key aspects of AD pathology are sleep impairments, 
associated with onset and progression of AD. AD mouse models may provide 
insights into mechanisms of AD-related sleep impairments. Such models may also 
help to establish new biomarkers predicting AD onset and monitoring AD 
progression. The present study aimed to establish sleep-related face validity of 
a widely used mouse model of AD (ArcAβ model) by comprehensively characterizing 
its baseline sleep/wake behavior. Chronic EEG recordings were performed 
continuously on four consecutive days in freely behaving mice. Spectral and 
temporal sleep/wake parameters were assessed and analyzed. EEG recordings showed 
decreased non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) and increased wakefulness in 
transgenic mice (TG). Vigilance state transitions were different in TG mice when 
compared to wildtype littermates (WT). During NREMS, TG mice had lower power 
between 1 and 5 Hz and increased power between 5 and 30 Hz. Sleep spindle 
amplitudes in TG mice were lower. Our study strongly provides sleep-linked face 
validity for the ArcAβ model. These findings extend the potential of the mouse 
model to investigate mechanisms of AD-related sleep impairments and the impact 
of sleep impairments on the development of AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in older 
adults, but most people are not diagnosed until significant neuronal loss has 
likely occurred along with a decline in cognition. Non-invasive and 
cost-effective digital biomarkers for AD have the potential to improve early 
detection.
OBJECTIVE: We examined the validity of DCTclockTM (a digitized clock drawing 
task) as an AD susceptibility biomarker.
DESIGN: We used two primary independent variables, Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 
allele carrier status and polygenic risk score (PRS). We examined APOE and PRS 
associations with DCTclockTM composite scores as dependent measures.
SETTING: We used existing data from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), a 
community-based study with the largest dataset of digital clock drawing data to 
date.
PARTICIPANTS: The sample consisted of 2,398 older adults ages 60-94 with 
DCTclockTM data (mean age of 72.3, 55% female and 92% White).
MEASUREMENTS: PRS was calculated using 38 variants identified in a recent large 
genome-wide association study (GWAS) and meta-analysis of late-onset AD (LOAD).
RESULTS: Results showed that DCTclockTM performance decreased with advancing 
age, lower education, and the presence of one or more copies of APOE ε4. Lower 
DCTclockTM Total Score as well as lower composite scores for Information 
Processing Speed (both command and copy conditions) and Drawing Efficiency 
(command condition) were significantly associated with higher PRS levels and 
more copies of APOE ε4. APOE and PRS associations displayed similar effect sizes 
in both men and women.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that higher AD genetic risk is associated with 
poorer DCTclockTM performance in older adults without dementia. This is the 
first study to demonstrate significant differences in clock drawing performance 
on the basis of APOE status or PRS.

BACKGROUND: In aging populations, more elderly patients are going to the 
intensive care unit (ICU) and surviving. However, the specific factors 
influencing the occurrence of post-intensive care syndrome in the elderly remain 
uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and 
risk of developing dementia within two years following critical care.
METHODS: This study included participants from the Korean National Health 
Insurance Service Cohort Database who had not been diagnosed with dementia and 
had been hospitalized in the ICU from 2003 to 2019. Dementia was determined 
using specific diagnostic codes (G30, G31) and prescription of certain 
medications (rivastigmine, galantamine, memantine, or donepezil). SES was 
categorized into low (medical aid beneficiaries) and non-low (National Health 
Insurance) groups. Through a 1:3 propensity score matching based on sex, age, 
Charlson comorbidity index, and primary diagnosis, the study included 16,780 
patients. We used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate adjusted hazard 
ratios (HR) of dementia.
RESULTS: Patients with low SES were higher risk of developing dementia within 2 
years after receiving critical care than those who were in non-low SES (HR: 
1.23, 95% CI: 1.04-1.46). Specifically, patients with low SES and those in the 
high-income group exhibited the highest incidence rates of developing dementia 
within two years after receiving critical care, with rates of 3.61 (95% CI: 
3.13-4.17) for low SES and 2.58 (95% CI: 2.20-3.03) for high income, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: After discharge from critical care, compared to the non-low SES 
group, the low SES group was associated with an increased risk of developing 
dementia.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a disorder characterized by cognitive decline, 
neurodegeneration, and accumulation of amyloid plaques and tau neurofibrillary 
tangles in the brain. Dysregulation of epigenetic histone modifications may lead 
to expression of transcriptional programs that play a role either in protecting 
against disease genesis or in worsening of disease pathology. One such histone 
modification, acetylation of histone H3 lysine residue 27 (H3K27ac), is 
primarily localized to genomic enhancer regions and promotes active gene 
transcription. We previously discovered H3K27ac to be more abundant in AD 
patient brain tissue compared to the brains of age-matched non-demented 
controls. In this study, we use iPSC-neurons derived from familial AD patients 
with an amyloid precursor protein (APP) duplication (APPDup neurons) as a model 
to study the functional effect of lowering CBP/P300 enzymes that catalyze 
H3K27ac. We found that homeostatic amyloid-reducing genes were upregulated in 
the APPDup neurons compared to non-demented controls. We lowered CBP/P300 to 
reduce H3K27ac, which led to decreased expression of numerous of these 
homeostatic amyloid-reducing genes, along with increased extracellular secretion 
of a toxic amyloid-β species, Aβ(1-42). Our findings suggest that epigenomic 
histone acetylation, including H3K27ac, drives expression of compensatory 
genetic programs in response to AD-associated insults, specifically those 
resulting from APP duplication, and thus may play a role in mitigating AD 
pathology in neurons.

OBJECTIVE: Doxorubicin (DXR) is commonly used as a drug for cancer treatment. 
However, there have been reports of neurotoxicity associated with chemotherapy. 
Galantamine (GLN) is a medication that inhibits cholinesterase activity, 
providing relief from the neurotoxic effects commonly seen in individuals with 
Alzheimer's disease. This study explored the potential ameliorative effect of 
GLN on brain neurotoxicity induced by DXR.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty rats were allocated into four separate groups for a 
study that lasted for a period of fourteen days. The control group was given 
normal saline, DXR group was given 5 mg/kg DXR every three days (cumulative dose 
of 20 mg/kg) through intraperitoneal injection. The GLN group was given 5 mg/kg 
GLN through oral gavage daily, while the DXR+GLN group was given DXR+GLN 
simultaneously. An analysis of brain proteins using ELISA to assess apoptosis 
through the concentration of inflammation and oxidative injury markers.
RESULTS: The DXR treatment led to increased neuroinflammation by elevation of 
nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), oxidative stress 
by rise of malondialdehyde (MDA), and decline of superoxide dismutase (SOD), and 
no changes in catalase and glutathione (GSH), cell death by elevation of Bax and 
caspase-3 and reduced Bcl-2, and increase lipid peroxidation, impaired 
mitochondrial function. When GLN is administered alongside DXR, it has been 
observed to positively impact various biological markers, including COX-2, 
NF-κB, MDA, SOD, Bax, Bcl-2, and caspase-3 levels. Additionally, GLN improves 
lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial activity.
CONCLUSIONS: DXR therapy in rats results in the development of neurotoxicity, 
and a combination of GLN can recover these toxicities, suggesting GLN promising 
evidence for mitigating the neurotoxic effects induced by DXR.

BACKGROUND: The association between vitamin D and dementia risk in those with 
prediabetes remains uncertain. We aimed to evaluate the association of serum 
25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) with incident dementia among older adults with 
prediabetes, and examine whether Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes, vitamin D 
receptor (VDR) and vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) gene polymorphisms may 
modify this association.
METHODS: 34,237 participants aged ≥60 with prediabetes (HbA1c <6.5% and ≥5.7%) 
and without dementia at baseline were included from the UK Biobank. Serum 
25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) was measured using chemiluminescent immunoassay 
method. The primary outcome was incident all-cause dementia. Secondary outcomes 
included incident Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular dementia, respectively. 
The VDR and VDBP gene polymorphisms included single nucleotide polymorphisms of 
rs7975232, rs1544410, rs2228570, rs731236, and rs7041, rs4588, respectively.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 11.8 years, 941 (2.7%) participants 
developed incident all-cause dementia. Overall, serum 25OHD was inversely 
associated with all-cause dementia (Per SD increment, adjusted HR: 0.82; 95%CI: 
0.75, 0.89). Similar trends were found for incident AD and vascular dementia. 
Furthermore, there was a stronger inverse relationship between serum 25OHD and 
all-cause dementia among VDR rs7975232 C allele non-carriers 
(P-interaction<0.05). However, APOE Ɛ4, other VDR and VDBP gene polymorphisms 
did not significantly modify the relation of serum 25OHD with incident all-cause 
dementia (All P-interactions >0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: There was an inverse association between serum 25OHD and incident 
dementia among older adults with prediabetes, especially in VDR rs7975232 AA 
allele carriers.

INTRODUCTION: In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), orthostatic hypotension (OH) 
was associated with cognition, but the mechanisms governing the link between OH 
and cognition are still unclear.
METHODS: We recruited T2DM with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, 
collected general healthy information and blood samples. Complement proteins of 
astrocyte-derived exosomes isolated and Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers of 
neuronal cell-derived exosomes isolated were quantified by ELISA. Cognitive 
assessments were performed at patient enrollment and follow-up.
RESULTS: Mediation analysis showed that the influence of OH on cognition in T2DM 
was partly mediated by baseline AD biomarkers and complement proteins. Cox 
proportional hazards regression proved OH group had a higher risk of developing 
dementia compared to T2DM without OH group.
DISCUSSION: In T2DM with MCI patients, AD biomarkers and complement proteins 
mediate the effects of OH on cognitive impairment and OH may be a risk factor of 
progression from MCI to dementia in T2DM.

Sciences, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden.

BACKGROUND: Dementia is an age-related disease associated with complex health 
and care needs. Due to demographical shifts, the number of older people with 
dementia is forecasted to increase. Occupational therapists encounter people 
with dementia in their daily work, yet little is known about their experience of 
working with people with dementia.
AIM/OBJECTIVES: To explore occupational therapist's experiences of working with 
people with dementia.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten occupational therapists were interviewed using 
semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic 
analysis.
RESULTS: The results are presented in five different themes: Working with 
persons who do not recognise decline in their abilities; Saving-face of the 
person in assessment situations; Facilitating continued engagement in everyday 
activities; Utilising information provided by care staff; Balancing different 
preferences on how to proceed.
CONCLUSION: Occupational therapists perceive a need in their work to employ 
various face-saving strategies and facilitate engagement in everyday activities. 
The results are exploratory and additionally research is needed to understand 
the therapists' experiences of working with persons with dementia.
SIGNIFICANCE: Everyday activities should be tailored to the person's abilities, 
with an emphasis on facilitating the person in carrying them out rather than the 
social environment taking them over.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a type of dementia that affects neuronal 
function, leading to a decline in cognitive functions. Serotonin-6 (5HT6) 
receptors are implicated in the etiology of neurological diseases. 5HT6 receptor 
antagonists act as anti-dementia agents.
PDB ID: 7YS6 represents a membrane protein, and amplification and overexpression 
of this protein are associated with Alzheimer's disease. Coumarin-fused 
phenothiazines are significant anti-Alzheimer's agents due to their inhibitory 
activity on the Serotonin- 6 receptor.
OBJECTIVES: Numerous previously unreported Coumarin-substituted Phenothiazines 
[A2 to A50] were designed using in-silico methods to evaluate their 5HT6 
receptor antagonistic activity. Molecular modeling techniques were employed to 
study the ligands [A2 to A50] in interaction with the Serotonin-6 receptor (PDB 
ID: 7YS6) using Schrödinger Suite 2019-4.
METHODS: Molecular modeling studies of the designed ligands [A2 to A50] were 
conducted using the Glide module. In-silico ADMET screening was performed using 
the QikProp module, and binding free energy calculations were carried out using 
the Prime MM-GBSA module within the Schrödinger Suite. The binding affinity of 
the designed ligands [A2 to A50] towards 5HT6 receptors was determined based on 
Glide scores. Subsequently, ligand A31 underwent a 100 ns molecular dynamics 
simulation using the Desmond module of Schrödinger Suite 2020-1, which is based 
in New York, NY.
RESULTS: The majority of the designed ligands exhibited strong hydrogen bonding 
interactions and hydrophobic associations with the serotonin-6 receptor, which 
hinder its activity. These ligands achieved remarkable Glide scores within the 
range of -4.2859 to -7.7128, in comparison to reference standards such as 
Idalopirdine (-7.78149), Intepirdine (-5.20103), Latrepirdine (-5.54853), and 
the co-crystallized ligand (-7.02889). In-silico ADMET properties for these 
ligands fell within the recommended values for drug-likeness. It is worth noting 
that the MM-GBSA binding free energy of the most potent inhibitor was positive, 
indicating a strong binding interaction. Additionally, the dynamic behavior of 
the protein (7YS6)-ligand (A31) complex was studied by subjecting ligand A31 to 
a 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study reveal strong evidence supporting the 
potential of coumarin- substituted phenothiazine derivatives as effective 
Serotonin-6 receptor antagonists. Ligands [A2 to A50], which exhibited 
noteworthy Glide scores, hold promise for significant anti- Alzheimer activity. 
Further in-vitro and in-vivo investigations are warranted to explore and confirm 
their therapeutic potential.

BACKGROUND: Evidence indicates the health care system disproportionately misses 
dementia in African American compared to White individuals. In preliminary data, 
we examined factors related to dementia identification by the health care system 
among African Americans.
METHODS: We leveraged linked Medicare fee-for-service claims and detailed annual 
cohort evaluations in African Americans from 4 cohorts at Rush Alzheimer's 
Disease Center.
RESULTS: Among 88 African Americans with cognitive impairment (mean = 10 years 
follow-up), Medicare claims identified dementia <2 years from cohort diagnosis 
in 55%; 27% were identified 2-9.9 years after cohort diagnosis, and in 18% there 
was either no claims diagnosis during the study period, or claims identified 
dementia 10+ years after cohort diagnosis. Claims identification of dementia was 
related to older age at cohort diagnosis (eg, <2 years between cohort and 
claims: mean = 82 years; 10+ years/no diagnosis: mean = 77 years, p = .04), 
lower Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (<2 years: mean = 24; 10+ 
years/no diagnosis: mean = 26, p = .04), more depressive symptoms (<2 years: 
mean = 2.1 symptoms; 10+ years/no diagnosis: mean = 1.2, p = .04), and more 
comorbidity (<2 years: mean = 5.6 comorbidities; 10+ years/no diagnosis, 
mean = 3.0, p = .02).
CONCLUSIONS: Among African Americans, preliminary data indicate the health care 
system most rapidly identifies dementia in older individuals, with worse 
cognitive and physical health. The health care system may miss opportunities for 
early support of African Americans with dementia, and caregivers.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of aggregated 
amyloid peptides in the brain parenchyma and within the walls of cerebral 
vessels. The hippocampus-a complex brain structure with a pivotal role in 
learning and memory-is implicated in this disease. However, there is limited 
data on vascular changes during AD pathological degeneration in this susceptible 
structure, which has distinctive vascular traits. Our aim was to evaluate 
vascular alterations in the hippocampus of AD patients and PDAPP-J20 mice-a 
model of AD-and to determine the impact of Aβ40 and Aβ42 on endothelial cell 
activation. We found a loss of physical astrocyte-endothelium interaction in the 
hippocampus of individuals with AD as compared to non-AD donors, along with 
reduced vascular density. Astrocyte-endothelial interactions and levels of the 
tight junction protein occludin were altered early in PDAPP-J20 mice, preceding 
any signs of morphological changes or disruption of the blood-brain barrier in 
these mice. At later stages, PDAPP-J20 mice exhibited decreased vascular density 
in the hippocampus and leakage of fluorescent tracers, indicating dysfunction of 
the vasculature and the BBB. In vitro studies showed that soluble Aβ40 exposure 
in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) was sufficient to induce 
NFκB translocation to the nucleus, which may be linked with an observed 
reduction in occludin levels. The inhibition of the membrane receptor for 
advanced glycation end products (RAGE) prevented these changes in HBMEC. 
Additional results suggest that Aβ42 indirectly affects the endothelium by 
inducing astrocytic factors. Furthermore, our results from human and mouse brain 
samples provide evidence for the crucial involvement of the hippocampal 
vasculature in Alzheimer's disease.

Human meprin β is a Zn2+-containing multidomain metalloprotease enzyme that 
belongs to the astacin family of the metzincin endopeptidase superfamily. Meprin 
β, with its diverse tissue expression pattern and wide substrate specificity, 
plays a significant role in various biological processes, including regulation 
of IL-6R pathways, lung fibrosis, collagen deposition, cellular migration, 
neurotoxic amyloid β levels, and inflammation. Again, meprin β is involved in 
Alzheimer's disease, hyperkeratosis, glomerulonephritis, diabetic kidney injury, 
inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer. Despite a crucial role in diverse 
disease processes, no such promising inhibitors of meprin β are marketed to 
date. Thus, it is an unmet requirement to find novel promising meprin β 
inhibitors that hold promise as potential therapeutics. In this study, a series 
of arylsulfonamide and tertiary amine-based hydroxamate derivatives as meprin β 
inhibitors has been analyzed through ligand-based and structure-based in silico 
approaches to pinpoint their structural and physiochemical requirements crucial 
for exerting higher inhibitory potential. This study identified different 
crucial structural features such as arylcarboxylic acid, sulfonamide, and 
arylsulfonamide moieties, as well as hydrogen bond donor and hydrophobicity, 
inevitable for exerting higher meprin β inhibition, providing valuable insight 
for their further future development.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

We hypothesized that subjects with heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) ACE 
mutations are at risk for Alzheimer's disease because amyloid Aβ42, a primary 
component of the protein aggregates that accumulate in the brains of AD 
patients, is cleaved by ACE (angiotensin I-converting enzyme). Thus, decreased 
ACE activity in the brain, either due to genetic mutation or the effects of ACE 
inhibitors, could be a risk factor for AD. To explore this hypothesis in the 
current study, existing SNP databases were analyzed for LoF ACE mutations using 
four predicting tools, including PolyPhen-2, and compared with the topology of 
known ACE mutations already associated with AD. The combined frequency of >400 
of these LoF-damaging ACE mutations in the general population is quite 
significant-up to 5%-comparable to the frequency of AD in the population > 70 
y.o., which indicates that the contribution of low ACE in the development of AD 
could be under appreciated. Our analysis suggests several mechanisms by which 
ACE mutations may be associated with Alzheimer's disease. Systematic analysis of 
blood ACE levels in patients with all ACE mutations is likely to have clinical 
significance because available sequencing data will help detect persons with 
increased risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Patients with 
transport-deficient ACE mutations (about 20% of damaging ACE mutations) may 
benefit from preventive or therapeutic treatment with a combination of chemical 
and pharmacological (e.g., centrally acting ACE inhibitors) chaperones and 
proteosome inhibitors to restore impaired surface ACE expression, as was shown 
previously by our group for another transport-deficient ACE mutation-Q1069R.

BACKGROUND: African Americans with MCI may be at increased risk for dementia 
compared to Caucasians. The effect of race on the efficacy of cognitive training 
in MCI is unclear.
METHODS: We used data from a two-site, 78-week randomized trial of MCI comparing 
intensive, home-based, computerized training with Web-based cognitive games or 
Web-based crossword puzzles to examine the effect of race on outcomes. The study 
outcomes were changes from baseline in cognitive and functional scales as well 
as MRI-measured changes in hippocampal volume and cortical thickness. Analyses 
used linear models adjusted for baseline scores. This was an exploratory study.
RESULTS: A total of 105 subjects were included comprising 81 whites (77.1%) and 
24 African Americans (22.8%). The effect of race on the change from baseline in 
ADAS-Cog-11 was not significant. The effect of race on change from baseline to 
week 78 in the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) was significant with 
African American participants' FAQ scores showing greater improvements at weeks 
52 and 78 (P = 0.009, P = 0.0002, respectively) than white subjects. Within the 
CCT cohort, FAQ scores for African American participants showed greater 
improvement between baseline and week 78, compared to white participants 
randomized to CCT (P = 0.006). There was no effect of race on the UPSA. There 
was no effect of race on hippocampal or cortical thickness outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings suggest that web-based cognitive training 
programs may benefit African Americans with MCI at least as much as Caucasians, 
and highlight the need to further study underrepresented minorities in AD 
prevention trials. (Supported by the National Institutes of Health, National

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful technology to investigate 
the transcriptional programs in stromal, immune, and disease cells, like tumor 
cells or neurons within the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) brain or tumor 
microenvironment (ME) or niche. Cell-cell communications within ME play 
important roles in disease progression and immunotherapy response and are novel 
and critical therapeutic targets. Though many tools of scRNA-seq analysis have 
been developed to investigate the heterogeneity and sub-populations of cells, 
few were designed for uncovering cell-cell communications of ME and predicting 
the potentially effective drugs to inhibit the communications. Moreover, the 
data analysis processes of discovering signaling communication networks and 
effective drugs using scRNA-seq data are complex and involve a set of critical 
analysis processes and external supportive data resources, which are difficult 
for researchers who have no strong computational background and training in 
scRNA-seq data analysis. To address these challenges, in this study, we 
developed a novel open-source computational tool, sc2MeNetDrug 
(https://fuhaililab.github.io/sc2MeNetDrug/). It was specifically designed using 
scRNA-seq data to identify cell types within disease MEs, uncover the 
dysfunctional signaling pathways within individual cell types and interactions 
among different cell types, and predict effective drugs that can potentially 
disrupt cell-cell signaling communications. sc2MeNetDrug provided a 
user-friendly graphical user interface to encapsulate the data analysis modules, 
which can facilitate the scRNA-seq data-based discovery of novel inter-cell 
signaling communications and novel therapeutic regimens.

With increasing interest in the inflammation-pathogen infection hypothesis and 
its potential links to Alzheimer's disease (AD) development, there is growing 
consideration of using upper respiratory infection (URI) treatments as 
interventions for AD. This nested case-control study explored the potential 
association between prior URI histories and AD development in a Korean adult 
population using the national health screening cohort data (2002-2019). The 
study included 26,920 AD patients and 107,680 matched control individuals, 
focusing on those seeking respiratory treatment. Logistic regression analyses 
assessed the impact of URI histories and treatment on AD risk while adjusting 
for covariates. Our results revealed that over a 1-year period, individuals with 
URI histories (≥1, ≥2, or ≥3 instances) exhibited decreasing probabilities of 
developing AD, with risk reductions of 19%, 15%, and 12%, respectively. 
Expanding our investigation to a 2-year period consistently showed a 17% 
reduction in AD risk. This effect remained robust across diverse demographic 
groups and after adjusting for covariates, encompassing comorbidities, 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, blood glucose levels, and lifestyle factors. 
Subgroup analyses further substantiated this association. In conclusion, our 
findings cautiously suggest a potential protective role of prior URI treatment 
histories in mitigating the risk of AD development.

Validation of the PRE-ADS-D consisted of assessments of reliability, structural 
validity using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Exploratory Factor 
Analysis (EFA) and construct validity using known-group tests. A subscale 
"Acceptability of Screening", with 5 PRE-ADS-D items, was extracted to measure 
acceptance of screening in clinical practice. The STROBE checklist was used for 
reporting.
RESULTS: EFA revealed a three-factor model for the PRE-ADS-D. Acceptable to good 
internal consistency was found for the 25-item scale (α= 0.78), as well as for 
the three factors "Concerns about Screening" (α= 0.85), "Intention to be 
Screened" (α= 0.87), and "Preventive Health Behaviors" (α= 0.81). Construct 
validity was confirmed for both the 25-item PRE-ADS-D and the "Acceptability of 
Screening" scale (α= 0.91). Overall, 51.2% of the participants showed a 
preference for screening. Non-parametric tests were conducted to further explore 
group differences of the sample.
CONCLUSIONS: The PRE-ADS-D is a reliable and valid tool to measure attitudes, 
motives, and barriers regarding pre-symptomatic dementia screening in the 
German-speaking general population. Additionally, the subscale "Acceptability of 
Screening" demonstrated good construct validity and reliability, suggesting its 
promising potential as a practical tool in clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Cholesterol (Cho) is an essential lipophilic molecule in cells; 
however, both its decrease and its increase may favor the development of 
neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although copper (Cu) is 
an essential trace metal for cells, the increased plasma concentration of its 
free form has been linked with AD development and severity. AD affects aged 
people, but its prevalence and severity are higher in women than in men. We have 
previously shown that Cu promotes Cho de novo synthesis in immature neurons as 
well as increased Cho in membrane rafts and Aβ levels in culture medium, but 
there are no results yet regarding sex differences in the effects of sublethal 
Cu exposure on Cho de novo synthesis.
METHODS: We examined the potential sex-specific impact of sublethal Cu 
concentrations on de novo Cho synthesis in primary cultures of male and female 
astrocytes. We also explored whether this had any correlation with variations in 
Cho and APP levels within neuronal membrane rafts.
RESULTS: Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that Cu treatment leads to a 
greater increase in ROS levels in female astrocytes than in males. Furthermore, 
through RT-PCR analysis, we observed an upregulation of SREBP-2 and HMGCR. 
Consistently, we observed an increase in de novo Cho synthesis. Finally, western 
blot analysis indicated that the levels of ABCA1 increase after Cu treatment, 
accompanied by a higher release of radiolabeled Cho and an elevation in Cho and 
APP levels in neuronal membrane rafts. Importantly, all these results were 
significantly more pronounced in female astrocytes than in males.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm that Cu stimulates Cho synthesis in 
astrocytes, both in a ROS-dependent and -independent manner. Moreover, female 
astrocytes displayed elevated levels of HMGCR, and de novo Cho synthesis 
compared to males following TBH and Cu treatments. This corresponds with higher 
levels of Cho released into the culture medium and a more significant Cho and 
APP rise within neuronal rafts. We consider that the increased risk of AD in 
females partly arises from sex-specific responses to metals and/or exogenous 
substances, impacting key enzyme regulation in various biochemical pathways, 
including HMGCR.

Plain Language Summary: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) primarily affects the elderly 
and is linked to excess cholesterol (Cho) and copper (Cu). It is more prevalent 
and severe in women. Previous research suggested that Cu may enhance Cho 
synthesis in developing neurons, raising Cho levels in specialized membrane 
structures (rafts) and Aβ protein in the culture medium. However, the specific 
effects of Cu exposure on Cho synthesis in males and females are not entirely 
understood. We conducted experiments using astrocytes, the primary cells in the 
brain that produce Cho in adults, and neurons, both from male and female rats. 
We exposed them to non-lethal levels of Cu to explore its potential sex-related 
effects on (1) Cho metabolism in astrocytes, and (2) The relationship between 
the Cho released by astrocytes and the levels of Cho and amyloid precursor 
protein (APP) in neuronal membrane rafts. Our findings suggested that reactive 
oxygen species (ROS)-responsive sensitivity is higher in females than in male 
astrocytes. Cu, alongside ROS, promoted Cho synthesis, with female astrocytes 
being more susceptible. These released more Cho into the medium after Cu 
exposure, and Cho and APP levels were also higher in female neuronal rafts 
exposed to Cu-treated astrocyte-conditioned medium. Our results thus imply that 
the higher risk of AD in females may arise partly from sex-related disparities 
in cellular responses to external substances, impacting such crucial biochemical 
pathways as Cho synthesis.

In this study, an exhaustive chemical characterization of a Dunaliella salina 
(DS) microalga extract obtained using supercritical fluids has been performed, 
and its neuroprotective capacity has been evaluated in vivo using an Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) transgenic model of Caenorhabditis elegans (strain CL4176). More 
than 350 compounds were annotated in the studied DS extract, with 
triacylglycerols, free fatty acids (FAs), carotenoids, apocarotenoids and 
glycerol being the most abundant. DS extract significantly protects C. elegans 
in a dose-dependent manner against Aβ-peptide paralysis toxicity, after 32 h, 
53% of treated worms at 50 µg/mL were not paralyzed. This concentration was 
selected to further evaluate the transcriptomics and metabolomics changes after 
26 h by using advanced analytical methodologies. The RNA-Seq data showed an 
alteration of 150 genes, mainly related to the stress and detoxification 
responses, and the retinol and lipid metabolism. The comprehensive metabolomics 
and lipidomics analyses allowed the identification of 793 intracellular 
metabolites, of which 69 were significantly altered compared to non-treated 
control animals. Among them, different unsaturated FAs, 
lysophosphatidylethanolamines, nucleosides, dipeptides and modified amino acids 
that have been previously reported as beneficial during AD progression, were 
assigned. These compounds could explain the neuroprotective capacity observed, 
thus, providing with new evidences of the protection mechanisms of this 
promising extract.

The bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) gene is an important risk locus for late-onset 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). BIN1 protein has been reported to mediate tau 
pathology, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show 
that neuronal BIN1 is cleaved by the cysteine protease legumain at residues N277 
and N288. The legumain-generated BIN1 (1-277) fragment is detected in brain 
tissues from AD patients and tau P301S transgenic mice. This fragment interacts 
with tau and accelerates its aggregation. Furthermore, the BIN1 (1-277) fragment 
promotes the propagation of tau aggregates by enhancing clathrin-mediated 
endocytosis (CME). Overexpression of the BIN1 (1-277) fragment in tau P301S mice 
facilitates the propagation of tau pathology, inducing cognitive deficits, while 
overexpression of mutant BIN1 that blocks its cleavage by legumain halts tau 
propagation. Furthermore, blocking the cleavage of endogenous BIN1 using the 
CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing tool ameliorates tau pathology and behavioral deficits. 
Our results demonstrate that the legumain-mediated cleavage of BIN1 plays a key 
role in the progression of tau pathology. Inhibition of legumain-mediated BIN1 
cleavage may be a promising therapeutic strategy for treating AD.

Recent findings highlight myelin breakdown as a decisive early event in 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) acting as aggravating factor of its progression. 
However, it is still unclear whether myelin loss is attributed to increased 
oligodendrocyte vulnerability, reduced repairing capacity or toxic stimuli. In 
the present study, we sought to clarify the starting point of myelin disruption 
accompanied with Oligodendrocyte Progenitor Cell (OPC) elimination in the brain 
of the 5xFAD mouse model of AD at 6 months of age in Dentate Gyrus of the 
hippocampus in relation to neurotrophin system. Prominent inflammation presence 
was detected since the age of 6 months playing a key role in myelin disturbance 
and AD progression. Expression analysis of neurotrophin receptors in OPCs was 
performed to identify new targets that could increase myelination in health and 
disease. OPCs in both control and 5xFAD mice express TrkB, TrkC and p75 
receptors but not TrkA. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) that binds to 
TrkB receptor is well-known about its pro-myelination effect, promoting 
oligodendrocytes proliferation and differentiation, so we focused our 
investigation on its effects in OPCs under neurodegenerative conditions. Our in 
vitro results showed that BDNF rescues OPCs from death and promotes their 
proliferation and differentiation in presence of the toxic Amyloid-β 1-42. 
Collectively, our results indicate that BDNF possess an additional 
neuroprotective role through its actions on oligodendrocytic component and its 
use could be proposed as a drug-based myelin-enhancing strategy, complementary 
to amyloid and tau centered therapies in AD.

INTRODUCTION: We estimated the ages when associations between Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) genes and brain volumes begin among middle-aged and older adults.
METHODS: Among 45,616 dementia-free participants aged 45-80, linear regressions 
tested whether genetic risk score for AD (AD-GRS) had age-dependent associations 
with 38 regional brain magnetic resonance imaging volumes. Models were adjusted 
for sex, assessment center, genetic ancestry, and intracranial volume.
RESULTS: AD-GRS modified the estimated effect of age (per decade) on the 
amygdala (-0.41 mm3 [-0.42, -0.40]); hippocampus (-0.45 mm3 [-0.45, -0.44]), 
nucleus accumbens (-0.55 mm3 [-0.56, -0.54]), thalamus (-0.38 mm3 [-0.39, 
-0.37]), and medial orbitofrontal cortex (-0.23 mm3 [-0.24, -0.22]). Trends 
began by age 45 for the nucleus accumbens and thalamus, 48 for the hippocampus, 
51 for the amygdala, and 53 for the medial orbitofrontal cortex. An AD-GRS 
excluding apolipoprotein E (APOE) was additionally associated with entorhinal 
and middle temporal cortices.
DISCUSSION: APOE and other genes that increase AD risk predict lower hippocampal 
and other brain volumes by middle age.

BACKGROUND: Concomitant cerebrovascular diseases (CeVD) have been identified as 
an important determinant of Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Development of 
robust blood-based biomarkers will provide critical tools to evaluate prognosis 
and potential interventional strategies for AD with CeVD.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigated circulating placental growth factor (PlGF), a 
potent pro-angiogenic factor related to endothelial dysfunction and vascular 
inflammation, in an Asian memory clinic cohort of non-demented individuals as 
well as AD, including its associations with neuroimaging markers of CeVD.
METHODS: 109 patients with AD, 76 cognitively impaired with no dementia (CIND), 
and 56 non-cognitively impaired (NCI) were included in this cross-sectional 
study. All subjects underwent 3T brain magnetic resonance imaging to assess 
white matter hyperintensities (WMH), lacunes, cortical infarcts, and cerebral 
microbleeds (CMBs). Serum PlGF concentrations were measured by 
electrochemiluminescence immunoassays.
RESULTS: Serum PlGF was elevated in AD, but not CIND, compared to the NCI 
controls. Adjusted concentrations of PlGF were associated with AD only in the 
presence of significant CeVD. Elevated PlGF was significantly associated with 
higher burden of WMH and with CMBs in AD patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum PlGF has potential utility as a biomarker for the presence of 
CeVD, specifically WMH and CMBs, in AD. Further studies are needed to elucidate 
the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms linking PlGF to CeVD, as well as to 
further assess PlGF's clinical utility.

Developing Explainable Deep Model for Discovering Novel Control Mechanism of 
Neuro-Dynamics.

Dan T, Kim M, Kim WH, Wu G.

Human brain is a complex system composed of many components that interact with 
each other. A well-designed computational model, usually in the format of 
partial differential equations (PDEs), is vital to understand the working 
mechanisms that can explain dynamic and self-organized behaviors. However, the 
model formulation and parameters are often tuned empirically based on the 
predefined domain-specific knowledge, which lags behind the emerging paradigm of 
discovering novel mechanisms from the unprecedented amount of spatiotemporal 
data. To address this limitation, we sought to link the power of deep neural 
networks and physics principles of complex systems, which allows us to design 
explainable deep models for uncovering the mechanistic role of how human brain 
(the most sophisticated complex system) maintains controllable functions while 
interacting with external stimulations. In the spirit of optimal control, we 
present a unified framework to design an explainable deep model that describes 
the dynamic behaviors of underlying neurobiological processes, allowing us to 
understand the latent control mechanism at a system level. We have uncovered the 
pathophysiological mechanism of Alzheimer's disease to the extent of 
controllability of disease progression, where the dissected system-level 
understanding enables higher prediction accuracy for disease progression and 
better explainability for disease etiology than conventional (black box) deep 
models.

BACKGROUND: With continuously aging societies, an increase in the number of 
people with cognitive decline is to be expected. Aside from the development of 
causative treatments, the successful implementation of prevention strategies is 
of utmost importance to reduce the high societal burden caused by 
neurodegenerative diseases leading to dementia among which the most common cause 
is Alzheimer's disease.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the Luxembourgish "programme dementia prevention (pdp)" is 
to prevent or at least delay dementia in an at-risk population through 
personalized multi-domain lifestyle interventions. The current work aims to 
provide a detailed overview of the methodology and presents initial results 
regarding the cohort characteristics and the implementation process.
METHODS: In the frame of the pdp, an extensive neuropsychological evaluation and 
risk factor assessment are conducted for each participant. Based on the results, 
individualized multi-domain lifestyle interventions are suggested.
RESULTS: A total number of 450 participants (Mean age = 69.5 years; SD = 10.8) 
have been screened at different recruitment sites throughout the country, among 
whom 425 participants (94.4%) met the selection criteria.
CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence supporting the feasibility of implementing a 
nationwide dementia prevention program and achieving successful recruitment of 
the target population by establishing a network of different healthcare 
providers.

Viscosity, an essential parameter of the cellular microenvironment, has the 
ability to indicate the condition of living cells. It is closely linked to 
numerous diseases like Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and cardiovascular 
disorders. Therefore, it is necessary to design tools to effectively monitor 
viscosity changes, which could provide promising avenues for therapeutic 
interventions in these diseases. Herein, we report a novel 
mitochondria-targeting fluorescent probe GX-VS which was suitable for the 
detection of viscosity changes in vivo and in vitro. The probe GX-VS had many 
advantages such as long emission wavelength (650 nm), large Stokes shift (105 
nm), significant fluorescence enhancement (59-fold), high sensitivity, good 
biocompatibility and so on. Biological experiments showed that the probe could 
target mitochondria and detect viscosity alterations in HeLa cells. Moreover, it 
has been successfully utilized to monitor viscosity changes induced by 
lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in inflammatory zebrafishes and living mice, which 
further underscored the capacity of GX-VS to explore fluctuations in viscosity 
within living organisms.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a widespread neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by progressive cognitive decline, affecting a significant portion 
of the aging population. While the cerebral cortex and hippocampus have been the 
primary focus of AD research, accumulating evidence suggests that white matter 
lesions in the brain, particularly in the corpus callosum, play an important 
role in the pathogenesis of the disease.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the gene expression changes in the 
corpus callosum of 5xFAD transgenic mice, a widely used AD mouse model.
METHODS: We conducted behavioral tests for spatial learning and memory in 5xFAD 
transgenic mice and performed RNA sequencing analyses on the corpus callosum to 
examine transcriptomic changes.
RESULTS: Our results show cognitive decline and demyelination in the corpus 
callosum of 5xFAD transgenic mice. Transcriptomic analysis reveals a 
predominance of upregulated genes in AD mice, particularly those associated with 
immune cells, including microglia. Conversely, downregulation of genes related 
to chaperone function and clock genes such as Per1, Per2, and Cry1 is also 
observed.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that activation of neuroinflammation, 
disruption of chaperone function, and circadian dysfunction are involved in the 
pathogenesis of white matter lesions in AD. The findings provide insights into 
potential therapeutic targets and highlight the importance of addressing white 
matter pathology and circadian dysfunction in AD treatment strategies.

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common contributor to dementia, is a growing 
global health problem. This study aimed to investigate the role of lemur 
tyrosine kinase 2 (LMTK2) in AD as well as its relevant mechanism. To establish 
an in vitro cell model, PC12 cells were challenged with 20 µmol/l Ab 25-35 for 
24 h. RT-qPCR and western blot examined LMTK2 mRNA and protein expressions. With 
the application of CCK-8, TUNEL, iron colorimetric assay kit and DCFH-DA, the 
viability, apoptosis, Fe 2+ and ROS content in PC12 cells were assessed. 
Besides, the expressions of oxidative stress-, apoptosis-, ferroptosis- and 
Nrf2/ARE signalling-related proteins were evaluated with western blot. Moreover, 
commercial kits examined SOD, MDA and CAT contents. The results manifested that 
LMTK2 expression was noticeably downregulated in Ab 25-35 -treated PC12 cells. 
Notably, LMTK2 overexpression exhibited inhibitory effects on oxidative stress, 
apoptosis and ferroptosis in PC12 cells exposed to Ab 25-35 . The upregulated 
Nrf2, NQO1 and HO-1 expressions in LMTK2 overexpressed-PC12 cells with Ab 25-35 
induction revealed that LMTK2 overexpression could activate the Nrf2/ARE 
signalling pathway. What is more, a series of cellular experiments further 
testified that ML385, a specific Nrf2 inhibitor, partly hindered the protective 
role of LMTK2 overexpression against Ab 25-35 -triggered oxidative stress, 
apoptosis and ferroptosis in PC12 cells. In conclusion, LMTK2 overexpression 
alleviated the ferroptosis, oxidant damage and apoptosis in PC12 cells exposed 
to Ab 25-35 through the activation of the Nrf2/ARE signalling pathway, 
indicating the potential target of LMTK2 in the treatment of AD.

BACKGROUND: Previous research has shown that verbal memory accurately measures 
cognitive decline in the early phases of neurocognitive impairment. Automatic 
speech recognition from the verbal learning task (VLT) can potentially be used 
to differentiate between people with and without cognitive impairment.
OBJECTIVE: Investigate whether automatic speech recognition (ASR) of the VLT is 
reliable and able to differentiate between subjective cognitive decline (SCD) 
and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: The VLT was recorded and processed via a mobile application. Following, 
verbal memory features were automatically extracted. The diagnostic performance 
of the automatically derived features was investigated by training machine 
learning classifiers to distinguish between participants with SCD versus 
MCI/dementia.
RESULTS: The ICC for inter-rater reliability between the clinical and 
automatically derived features was 0.87 for the total immediate recall and 0.94 
for the delayed recall. The full model including the total immediate recall, 
delayed recall, recognition count, and the novel verbal memory features had an 
AUC of 0.79 for distinguishing between participants with SCD versus 
MCI/dementia. The ten best differentiating VLT features correlated low to 
moderate with other cognitive tests such as logical memory tasks, semantic 
verbal fluency, and executive functioning.
CONCLUSIONS: The VLT with automatically derived verbal memory features showed in 
general high agreement with the clinical scoring and distinguished well between 
SCD and MCI/dementia participants. This might be of added value in screening for 
cognitive impairment.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) leads to gradual memory loss including other 
compromised cognitive abilities. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an important 
biochemical enzyme from the cholinesterase (ChE) family, is recognized as 
primary pharmacological target for treating AD. Currently marketed drugs for AD 
treatment are primarily AChE inhibitors and coumarin derivatives comprising a 
wide variety of pharmacological activities have proved their efficacy towards 
AChE inhibition. Ensaculin (KA-672 HCl), a compound that belong to the coumarin 
family, is a clinical trial candidate for AD treatment. Therefore, a ligand 
library was prepared with 60 reported coumarin derivatives for field-based 
3D-QSAR and pharmacophore modelling. The field-based 3D-QSAR model obtained at 
partial least square (PLS) factor 7, was the best validated model that predicted 
activity closer to original activity for each ligand introduced. The contour 
maps demonstrated spatial distribution of favourable and unfavorable steric, 
hydrophobic, electrostatic and H-bond donor and acceptor contours around 
coumarin nucleus. The best pharmacophore model, ADHRR_1 exhibited five essential 
pharmacophoric features of four different traits for optimum AChE inhibition. 
Virtual screening through ADHRR_1 accompanied with molecular docking and MM/GBSA 
identified 10 HITs from a 4,00,000 coumarin derivatives from PubChem database. 
HITs comprised docking scores ranging from -12.096 kcal/mol to -8.271 kcal/mol 
and compared with the reference drug Donepezil (-8.271 kcal/mol). ADME 
properties analysis led into detecting two leads (HIT 1 and HIT 2) among these 
10 HITs. Molecular Dynamics Simulation indicated thermodynamic stability of the 
complex of lead compounds with AChE protein. Finally, thorough survey of the 
experimental results from 3D-QSAR modelling, pharmacophore modelling and 
molecular docking interactions led us to develop the lead formula I for future 
advancements in treating AD through AChE inhibitors.

BACKGROUND:  In the United States, Latino caregivers of individuals with 
dementia face unique challenges and an elevated risk of adverse health outcomes. 
Despite the increasing prevalence of Alzheimer disease and related dementias 
among Latino adults, few evidence-based interventions are tailored to their 
cultural context. To address this gap, we examined the cultural adaptations 
required for the STAR caregivers (STAR-C) virtual intervention, an 
evidence-based intervention that educates family caregivers to manage behavioral 
and psychological symptoms of dementia. While STAR-C has shown effectiveness, 
neither the original in-person nor the virtual intervention considered the 
distinct experiences of Latino caregivers, who often bring culturally 
significant values into caregiving interactions.
OBJECTIVE: This study's objective was to test and refine the preliminary 
cultural adaptations of the STAR-C web-based training modules for Latino 
caregivers of people living with dementia.
METHODS: Through qualitative interviews with 15 Latino caregivers in Washington 
State, we identified key adaptations to enhance the cultural relevance of the 
web-based training modules.
RESULTS: The interviews highlighted 4 main themes for adaptation: the delivery 
of the STAR-C web-based training modules, comprehensive dementia education, 
simplified problem-solving strategies, and prioritizing caregiver well-being.
CONCLUSIONS: This study's findings informed the development of culturally 
adapted STAR-C web-based training modules that aim to provide tailored support 
to Latino caregivers. While further research is needed to assess the efficacy of 
these adaptations, our work contributes to bridging the gap in dementia 
caregiving for Latino families, potentially reducing health disparities and 
enhancing health care services for this population.

We have synthesized 22 C-1 functionalized-N-aryl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline 
derivatives showing biological activities towards cholinergic enzymes. Synthesis 
was performed using visible-light-promoted photo-redox chemistry, starting from 
a common intermediate, and the application of this synthetic methodology 
drastically simplified synthetic routes and purification of desired compounds. 
All synthesized derivates were divided into four groups based on the 
substituents in the C-1 position, and their inhibition potencies towards two 
cholinergic enzymes, acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase were evaluated. Most 
potent derivatives were selected, and kinetic analysis was further carried out 
to obtain insights into the mechanisms of inhibition of these two enzymes. 
Further validation of the mode of inhibition of cholinergic enzymes by the two 
most potent THIQ compounds, 3c and 3i, was performed using 
fluorescence-quenching titration studies. Molecular docking studies further 
confirmed the proposed mechanism of enzymes' inhibition. In silico predictions 
of physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetics, drug-likeness, and medicinal 
chemistry friendliness of the selected most potent derivatives were performed 
using Swiss ADME tool. This was followed by UPLC-assisted log P determination 
and in vitro BBB permeability studies performed in order to assess the potential 
of the synthesized compounds to pass the BBB.

Deep Causality Variational Autoencoder Network for Identifying the Potential 
Biomarkers of Brain Disorders.

Alfakih A, Xia Z, Ali B, Mamoon S, Lu J.

Identifying causality from observational time-series data is a key problem in 
dealing with complex dynamic systems. Inferring the direction of connection 
between brain regions (i.e., causality) has become the central topic in the 
domain of fMRI. The purpose of this study is to obtain causal graphs that 
characterize the causal relationship between brain regions based on time series 
data. To address this issue, we designed a novel model named deep causal 
variational autoencoder (CVAE) to estimate the causal relationship between brain 
regions. This network contains a causal layer that can estimate the causal 
relationship between different brain regions directly. Compared with previous 
approaches, our method relaxes many constraints on the structure of underlying 
causal graph. Our proposed method achieves excellent performance on both the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Autism Brain Imaging 
Data Exchange 1 (ABIDE1) databases. Moreover, the experimental results show that 
deep CVAE has promising applications in the field of brain disease 
identification.

Presenilin 1 (PS1) is a transmembrane proteolytic subunit of γ-secretase that 
cleaves amyloid precursor proteins. Mutations in PS1 (mPS1) are associated with 
early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). The link between mutated PS1, 
mitochondrial calcium regulation, and AD has been studied extensively in 
different test systems. Despite the wide-ranging role of mPS1 in AD, there is a 
paucity of information on the link between PS1 and neuronal cell death, a 
hallmark of AD. In the present study, we employed the selective mitochondrial 
uncoupler carbonyl cyanide chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and compared the 
reactivity of mPS1-transfected cultured rat hippocampal neurons with PS1 and 
control neurons in a situation of impaired mitochondrial functions. CCCP causes 
a slow rise in cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium in all three groups of 
neurons, with the mPS1 neurons demonstrating a faster rise. Consequently, mPS1 
neurons were depolarized by CCCP and measured with TMRM, a mitochondrial voltage 
indicator, more than the other two groups. Morphologically, CCCP produced more 
filopodia in mPS1 neurons than in the other two groups, which were similarly 
affected by the drug. Finally, mPS1 transfected neurons tended to die from 
prolonged exposure to CCCP sooner than the other groups, indicating an increase 
in vulnerability associated with a lower ability to regulate excess cytosolic 
calcium.

BACKGROUND: The evidence underpinning palliative care in dementia is mostly 
based on research in older populations. Little is known about the palliative 
care needs of people with young-onset dementia (YOD).
OBJECTIVE: To describe palliative care practices including advance care planning 
(ACP) in people with YOD residing in Dutch nursing homes.
METHODS: The study presents baseline questionnaire data from an observational 
cohort study. Physicians, family caregivers, and nursing staff completed 
questionnaires about 185 residents with YOD. The questionnaires included items 
on sociodemographics, quality of life measured with the quality of life in 
late-stage dementia (QUALID) scale, dementia-related somatic health problems, 
symptoms, pain medication, psychotropic drugs, and ACP.
RESULTS: The mean age was 63.9 (SD 5.8) years. Half (50.3%) of them were female. 
Alzheimer's disease dementia (42.2%) was the most prevalent subtype. The mean 
QUALID score was 24.0 (SD 7.9) as assessed by family caregivers, and 25.3 (SD 
8.6) as assessed by the nursing staff. Swallowing problems were the most 
prevalent dementia-related health problem (11.4%). Agitation was often reported 
by physicians (42.0%) and nursing staff (40.5%). Psychotropics were prescribed 
frequently (72.3%). A minority had written advance directives (5.4%) or 
documentation on treatment preferences by the former general practitioner 
(27.2%). Global care goals most often focused on comfort (73.9%). Proportions of 
do-not-treat orders were higher than do-treat orders for all interventions 
except for hospitalization and antibiotics.
CONCLUSIONS: ACP must be initiated earlier, before nursing home admission. A 
palliative approach seems appropriate even though residents are relatively young 
and experience few dementia-related health problems.

BACKGROUND: Prognosis of future risk of dementia from neuroimaging and cognitive 
data is important for optimizing clinical management for patients at early stage 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, existing studies lack an efficient way to 
integrate longitudinal information from both modalities to improve prognosis 
performance.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim to develop and evaluate an explainable deep 
learning-based framework to predict mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD 
conversion within four years using longitudinal whole-brain 3D MRI and 
neurocognitive tests.
METHODS: We proposed a two-stage framework that first uses a 3D convolutional 
neural network to extract single-timepoint MRI-based AD-related latent features, 
followed by multi-modal longitudinal feature concatenation and a 1D 
convolutional neural network to predict the risk of future dementia onset in 
four years.
RESULTS: The proposed deep learning framework showed promising to predict MCI to 
AD conversion within 4 years using longitudinal whole-brain 3D MRI and cognitive 
data without extracting regional brain volumes or cortical thickness, reaching a 
balanced accuracy of 0.834, significantly improved from models trained from 
single timepoint or single modality. The post hoc model explainability revealed 
heatmap indicating regions that are important for predicting future risk of AD.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed framework sets the stage for future studies for using 
multi-modal longitudinal data to achieve optimal prediction for prognosis of AD 
onset, leading to better management of the diseases, thereby improving the 
quality of life.

Disclosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers to research participants is a 
growing practice. Here, we aim to synthesize the experiences of clinicians 
leading preclinical AD biomarker disclosure. Semi-structured interviews were 
conducted individually with each of the four clinicians conducting biomarker 
disclosure as a part of a longitudinal, observational AD cohort study. Study 
clinicians emphasized the importance of participant education, having adequate 
time available for the disclosure visit, and forms to facilitate disclosure. To 
train and support future clinicians conducting AD biomarker disclosure, our 
study clinicians highlighted providing information about AD and biomarkers, 
shadowing a disclosure visit, having team debriefing sessions, and collating a 
frequently asked questions document. To date, this is the first characterization 
of clinician reflections on disclosing AD biomarker result to cognitively 
unimpaired research participants. As more clinicians in research or clinical 
settings seek to disclose AD biomarker results, best practices for training 
clinicians to lead disclosure are necessary.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves brain neuropathologies such as 
amyloid plaque and hyperphosphorylated tau tangles and is accompanied by 
cognitive decline. Identifying the biological mechanisms underlying disease 
onset and progression based on quantifiable phenotypes will help understand 
disease etiology and devise therapies.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to identify molecular pathways associated with 
hallmark AD biomarkers and cognitive status, accounting for variables such as 
age, sex, education, and APOE genotype.
METHODS: We introduce a pathway-based statistical approach, extending the gene 
set likelihood ratio test to continuous phenotypes. We first analyzed 
independently each of the three phenotypes (amyloid-β, tau, cognition) using 
continuous gene set likelihood ratio tests to account for covariates, including 
age, sex, education, and APOE genotype. The analysis involved 634 subjects with 
data available for all three phenotypes, allowing for the identification of 
common pathways.
RESULTS: We identified 14 pathways significantly associated with amyloid-β; 5 
associated with tau; and 174 associated with cognition, which showed a larger 
number of pathways compared to biomarkers. A single pathway, vascular 
endothelial growth factor receptor binding (VEGF-RB), exhibited associations 
with all three phenotypes. Mediation analysis showed that among the VEGF-RB 
family genes, ITGA5 mediates the relationship between cognitive scores and 
pathological biomarkers.
CONCLUSIONS: We presented a new statistical approach linking continuous 
phenotypes, gene expression across pathways, and covariates like sex, age, and 
education. Our results reinforced VEGF RB2's role in AD cognition and 
demonstrated ITGA5's significant role in mediating the AD pathology-cognition 
connection.

A diarylethene-based probe 
(Z)-N'-((2-amino-5-chlorophenyl)(phenyl)methylene)-2-hydroxy benzohydrazide 
(KBH) has been proficiently developed and its structure has been confirmed by 
single crystal X-ray diffraction technique. It displays a selective and 
sensitive colorimetric sensing of Cu2+ ions in aqueous medium with a naked eye 
colour change from colourless to yellow. It exhibits a significantly low limit 
of detection as 1.5 nM. A plausible binding mechanism has been proposed using 
Job's plot, FT-IR, 1H NMR titration, HRMS and DFT studies. The chemosensor is 
effectively reversible and reusable with EDTA. Test strip kit and real water 
sample analysis have been shown to establish its practical applicability. 
Further, the potential of KBH for the early diagnosis of Cu2+ ion-induced 
amyloid toxicity has been investigated in eye imaginal disc of Alzheimer's 
disease model of Drosophila 3rd instar larvae. The in-vivo interaction of KBH 
with Cu2+ in gut tissues of Drosophila larvae establishes its sensing capability 
in biological system. Interestingly, the in-vivo detection of Cu2+ has been done 
using bright field imaging which eliminates the necessity of a fluorescent 
label, hence making the method highly economical.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent age-related dementia, 
and, despite numerous attempts to halt or reverse its devastating progression, 
no effective therapeutics have yet been confirmed clinically. However, one class 
of agents that has shown promise is certain metal chelators.
OBJECTIVE: For the novel assessment of the effect of oral administration of 
1,10-phenanthroline-5-amine (PAA) on the severity of amyloid plaque load, we 
used a transgenic (Tg) mouse model with inserted human autosomally dominant 
(familial) AD genes: amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) and tau.
METHODS: AβPP/Tau transgenic mice that model AD were allotted into one of two 
groups. The control group received no treatment while the experimental group 
received PAA in their drinking water starting at 4 months of age. All animals 
were sacrificed at 1 year of age and their brains were stained with two 
different markers of amyloid plaques, Amylo-Glo+ and HQ-O.
RESULTS: The control animals exhibited numerous dense core plaques throughout 
the neo- and allo- cortical brain regions. The experimental group treated with 
PAA, however, showed 62% of the amyloid plaque burden seen in the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral daily dosing with PAA will significantly reduce the amyloid 
plaque burden in transgenic mice that model AD. The underlying mechanism for 
this protection is not fully known; however, one proposed mechanism involves 
inhibiting the "metal-seeding" of Aβ.

Conditions such as hyperglycemia and oxidative stress lead to the formation of 
advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are harmful compounds that have 
been implicated in dementia. Within the Rotterdam Study, we measured skin AGEs 
as skin autofluorescence, reflecting long-term accumulation of AGEs, and 
determined their association with the risk of dementia and with brain magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) measures. Skin autofluorescence was measured between 
2013 and 2016 in 2922 participants without dementia. Of these, 1504 also 
underwent brain MRI, on which measures of brain atrophy and cerebral small 
vessel disease were assessed. All participants were followed for the incidence 
of dementia until 2020. Of 2922 participants (mean age 72.6 years, 57% women), 
123 developed dementia. Higher skin autofluorescence (per standard deviation) 
was associated with an increased risk of dementia (hazard ratio 1.21 [95% 
confidence interval 1.01-1.46]) and Alzheimer's disease (1.19 [0.97-1.47]), 
independently of age and other studied potential confounders. Stronger effects 
were seen in apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers (1.34 [0.98-1.82]) and in 
participants with diabetes (1.35 [0.94-1.94]). Participants with higher skin 
autofluorescence levels also had smaller total brain volumes and smaller 
hippocampus volumes on MRI, and they had more often lacunes. These results 
suggest that AGEs may be involved in dementia pathophysiology.

BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is the most prevalent genetic risk factor 
of Alzheimer's disease. Several studies suggest that APOE4 binding to its 
receptors is associated with their internalization and accumulation in 
intracellular compartments. Importantly, this phenomenon also occurs with other, 
non-ApoE receptors. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that APOE4 
pathological effects are mediated by impairment in the life cycle of distinct 
receptors (APOER2, LRP1, IR, VEGFR).
OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of APOE genotype on receptors protein levels 
and compartmentalization.
METHODS: Primary mouse neurons were prepared from APOE3 or APOE4 targeted 
replacement mice, or APOE-KO mice. Specific receptors protein levels were 
evaluated in these neurons, utilizing immunofluorescent staining. Additionally, 
surface membrane protein levels of those receptors were assessed by cell surface 
biotinylation assay and ELISA. Receptors' colocalization with intracellular 
compartments was assessed by double staining and confocal microscopy, followed 
by colocalization analysis. Finally, LRP1 or APOER2 were knocked-down with 
CRISPR/Cas9 system to examine their role in mediating APOE4 effects on the 
receptors.
RESULTS: Our results revealed lower receptors' levels in APOE4, specifically on 
the membrane surface. Additionally, APOE4 affects the compartmentation of these 
receptors in two patterns: the first was observed with LRP1 and was associated 
with decreased receptor levels in numerous intracellular compartments. The 
second was obtained with the other receptors and was associated with their 
accumulation in early endosomes and their decrease in the late endosomes.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide a unifying mechanism, in which APOE4 drives 
the down regulation of various receptors, which plays important roles in 
distinct APOE4 related pathological processes.

INTRODUCTION: Neuropathological investigation of presymptomatic or early 
symptomatic presenilin-1 (PSEN1) mutation carriers in familial Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) is extremely scarce.
METHODS: We report the autopsy findings of brothers with familial AD. Case 1 is 
a 45-year-old man without obvious cognitive impairment, who committed suicide. 
Case 2 is a 57-year-old older brother of Case 1 with advanced AD symptoms, who 
died of hypothermia during wondering.
RESULTS: In both cases, abundant amyloid plaques positive for amyloid β (Aβ) 
were found throughout the brain. Progression of neuronal loss and increasing 
amount and extension of neurofibrillary tangle pathology were evident in Case 2. 
Genetic investigation revealed a PSEN1_p. L392V mutation in both cases.
DISCUSSION: The present study shows a possible neuropathological boundary 
between symptomatic and preclinical AD with pathogenic PSEN1 mutation. 
Additional clinicopathological investigation for familial AD-related mutation 
carriers may be significant to explore the association between familial AD and 
suicide.

BACKGROUND: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) refers to the self-reported 
persistent cognitive decline despite normal objective testing, increasing the 
risk of dementia compared to cognitively normal individuals.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the attributes of SCD patients who 
demonstrated memory function improvement.
METHODS: In this prospective study of SCD, a total of 120 subjects were enrolled 
as part of a multicenter cohort study aimed at identifying predictors for the 
clinical progression to mild cognitive impairment or dementia (CoSCo study). All 
subjects underwent 18F-florbetaben PET and brain MRI scans at baseline and 
annual neuropsychological tests. At the 24-month follow-up, we classified SCD 
patients based on changes in memory function, the z-score of the Seoul verbal 
learning test delayed recall.
RESULTS: Of the 120 enrolled patients, 107 successfully completed the 24-month 
follow-up assessment. Among these, 80 patients (74.8%) with SCD exhibited memory 
function improvements. SCD patients with improved memory function had a lower 
prevalence of coronary artery disease at baseline and performed better in the 
trail-making test part B compared to those without improvement. Anatomical and 
biomarker analysis showed a lower frequency of amyloid PET positivity and larger 
volumes in the left and right superior parietal lobes in subjects with improved 
memory function.
CONCLUSIONS: Our prospective study indicates that SCD patients experiencing 
memory improvement over a 24-month period had a lower amyloid burden, fewer 
cardiovascular risk factors, and superior executive cognitive function. 
Identifying these key factors associated with cognitive improvement may assist 
clinicians in predicting future memory function improvements in SCD patients.

Concerns about poor animal to human translation have come increasingly to the 
fore, in particular with regards to cognitive improvements in rodent models, 
which have failed to translate to meaningful clinical benefit in humans. This 
problem has been widely acknowledged, most recently in the field of Alzheimer's 
disease, although this issue pervades the spectrum of central nervous system 
(CNS) disorders, including neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, and 
neurodegenerative diseases. Consequently, recent efforts have focused on 
improving preclinical to clinical translation by incorporating more clinically 
analogous outcome measures of cognition, such as touchscreen-based assays, which 
can be employed across species, and have great potential to minimize the 
translational gap. For aging-related research, it also is important to 
incorporate model systems that facilitate the study of the long prodromal phase 
in which cognitive decline begins to emerge and which is a major limitation of 
short-lived species, such as laboratory rodents. We posit that to improve 
translation of cognitive function and dysfunction, nonhuman primate models, 
which have conserved anatomical and functional organization of the primate 
brain, are necessary to move the field of translational research forward and to 
bridge the translational gaps. The present studies describe the establishment of 
a comprehensive battery of touchscreen-based tasks that capture a spectrum of 
domains sensitive to detecting aging-related cognitive decline, which will 
provide the greatest benefit through longitudinal evaluation throughout the 
prolonged lifespan of the marmoset.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies have indicated that noninvasive brain stimulation 
combined with cognitive interval (NIBS-CI) improved cognitive function in people 
with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Amnesic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI). 
While previous interventions have demonstrated that a single targeted cognitive 
intervention can improve cognitive function, the outcomes of using both 
interventions simultaneously are less well-established. Therefore, this study 
aims to perform a meta-analysis to determine the effectiveness of NIBS-CI in 
treating cognitive impairment associated with AD and a-MCI, with the goal of 
obtaining novel insights into this combined intervention.
METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, ProQuest and Central Cochrane library databases 
were searched up to December 2022. The primary cognitive outcomes were extracted 
from the included article. A mean difference (MD) and standardized mean 
difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval were calculated by using 
random-effect models.
RESULTS: Twelve studies with a total of 587 AD patients were included. The 
findings demonstrated that NIBS-CI significantly improved cognitive function of 
AD patients in cognitive outcomes (SMD = -0.52, 95%CI (-0. 93, -0.11)) and 
ADAS-COG (MD = -1.16, 95%CI (-1.69, -0.63)). The pooled results showed that 
NIBS-CI did not improve cognitive function of AD patients in short-time memory 
(SMD = 0.057, 95%CI (-0.13, 0.25), P = 0.56) and long-time memory (SMD = 0.001, 
95%CI (-0.20, 0.20), P = 0.99).
CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence for a positive effect of NIBS-CI on overall 
cognitive function of AD and a-MCI. Considering the limited sample size, it is 
important to interpret the findings related to memory with caution. To obtain 
more robust results, future studies should be conducted with larger sample sizes 
and incorporate objective neurophysiological and neuroimaging tools. These 
methodological enhancements will allow for a better understanding of the 
therapeutic targets and provide a more comprehensive assessment of the effects 
of NIBS-CI treatment.

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors play a crucial role in the treatment of 
Alzheimer's disease. These drugs increase acetylcholine levels by inhibiting the 
enzyme responsible for its degradation, which is a vital neurotransmitter 
involved in memory and cognition. This intervention intermittently improves 
cognitive symptoms and augments neurotransmission. This study investigates the 
potential of Psidium guajava fruit extract as an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) 
inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease treatment. Molecular characteristics and 
drug-likeness were analyzed after HR-LCMS revealed phytocompounds in an 
ethanolic extract of Psidium guajava fruit. Selected phytocompounds were 
subjected to molecular docking against AChE, with the best-docked compound then 
undergoing MD simulation, MMGBSA, DCCM, FEL, and PCA investigations to evaluate 
the complex stability. The hit compound's potential toxicity and further 
pharmacokinetic features were also predicted. Anticholinesterase activity was 
also studied using in vitro assay. The HR-LCMS uncovered 68 compounds. Based on 
computational analysis, Fluspirilene was determined to have the highest 
potential to inhibit AChE. It was discovered that the Fluspirilene-AChE complex 
is stable and that Fluspirilene has a high binding affinity for AChE. Extract of 
Psidium guajava fruit significantly inhibits AChE (88.37% at 200 μg/ml). It is 
comparable to the standard AChE inhibitor Galantamine. Fluspirilene exhibited 
remarkable binding to AChE. Psidium guajava fruit extract demonstrated 
substantial AChE inhibitory activity, indicating its potential for Alzheimer's 
treatment. The study underscores natural sources' significance in drug 
discovery.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

Indigenous to Lebanon, Origanum syriacum L. and Cousinia libanotica D.C. are 
notable plants in the Middle East, with O. syriacum known for its aromatic 
qualities and C. libanotica being less explored. Both plants have a significant 
role in traditional medicine for treating various ailments. This study aimed to 
evaluate the phytochemical composition and biological properties of the extracts 
from these plants. The extracts were obtained through cold maceration with 
solvents of increasing polarity. The ethyl acetate extract of O. syriacum 
exhibited the highest total polyphenol content. High-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC) identified fifteen compounds in both C. libanotica and O. 
syriacum extracts, whereas gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis 
unveiled 179 volatile compounds. Notably, the O. syriacum-MeOH extract showed 
moderate antioxidant activity. Both plants' methanolic extracts demonstrated 
significant anti-Alzheimer's potential. The O. syriacum-dichloromethane and C. 
libanotica-cyclohexane extracts displayed the highest cytotoxicities against the 
HCT-116 cell line. For anti-proliferative activity against the Caco-2 cell line, 
the O. syriacum-methanol and C. libanotica-cyclohexane extracts were the most 
effective. This study provides valuable insights into the phytochemistry and 
potential therapeutic applications of extracts from these two oriental plant 
species.

Triacylglycerols and wax esters are two lipid classes that have been linked to 
diseases, including autism, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, cardiovascular 
disease, dry eye disease, and diabetes, and thus are molecules worthy of 
biomarker exploration studies. Since triacylglycerols and wax esters make up the 
majority of skin-surface lipid secretions, a viable sampling method for these 
potential biomarkers would be that of groomed latent fingerprints. Currently, 
however, blood-based sampling protocols predominate in the field. The 
invasiveness of a blood draw limits its utility to protected populations, 
including children and the elderly. Herein we describe a noninvasive means for 
sample collection (from fingerprints) paired with fast MS data-acquisition 
(MassIVE data set MSV000092742) and efficient data analysis via machine 
learning. Using both supervised and unsupervised classification, we demonstrate 
the usefulness of this method in determining whether a variable of interest 
imparts measurable change within the lipidomic data set. As a proof-of-concept, 
we show that the method is capable of distinguishing between the fingerprints of 
different individuals as well as between anatomical sebum collection regions. 
This noninvasive, high-throughput approach enables future lipidomic biomarker 
researchers to more easily include underrepresented, protected populations, such 
as children and the elderly, thus moving the field closer to definitive disease 
diagnoses that apply to all.

The International CTAD Task Force (TF) addressed challenges related to designing 
clinical trials for agitation in dementia, presenting accomplishments from the 
two previous TFs on neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). In addition, this TF 
proposed a paradigm shift in NPS assessment and management, presenting Mild 
Behavioral Impairment (MBI) as a clinical syndrome. MBI is marked by later-life 
emergent and persistent NPS in dementia-free older persons (ranging from 
cognitively unimpaired to subjective cognitive decline to mild cognitive 
impairment), which facilitates earlier detection and better prognostication of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). The TF has made the following recommendations for 
incorporation of NPS into AD preventative trials: (1) clinical trials targeting 
improvement in MBI symptoms should be undertaken; (2) treatment trials for MBI 
should be disease specific and confirm the diagnosis of participants using 
biomarkers; trials should include measures sensitive to cognitive changes in 
preclinical AD, which can serve as outcome measures, in addition to changes in 
biomarker levels; (3) as a first step, pharmacotherapeutic trials should address 
the full MBI complex as well as the specific symptoms/domains that constitute 
MBI; (4) clinical trials using problem-adaptation psychotherapy to target 
affective MBI should be considered; and (5) MBI should be considered in AD 
trials of disease modifying therapies. The well-validated and widely-used MBI 
Checklist (MBI-C) is an appropriate symptom rating scale for these studies, as 
it was developed specifically to identify and measure MBI in dementia-free 
persons. Other scales such as the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) may be used, 
although administration at two timepoints may be necessary to operationalize the 
MBI criterion of symptom persistence.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the loss of memory due to 
aggregation of misphosphorylated tau and amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques in the brain, 
elevated release of inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) 
and reactive oxygen species from astrocytes, and subsequent neurodegeneration. 
Recently, it was found that enzyme Ornithine Decarboxylase 1 (ODC1) acts as a 
bridge between the astrocytic urea cycle and the putrescine-to-GABA conversion 
pathway in the brain of AD mouse models as well as human patients. In this 
study, we show that the long-term knockdown of astrocytic Odc1 in APP/PS1 
animals was sufficient to completely clear Aβ plaques in the hippocampus while 
simultaneously switching the astrocytes from a detrimental reactive state to a 
regenerative active state, characterized by proBDNF expression. Our experiments 
also reveal an effect of astrocytic ODC1 inhibition on the expression of genes 
involved in synapse pruning and organization, histone modification, apoptotic 
signaling and protein processing. These genes are previously known to be 
associated with astrocytic activation and together create a 
neuroregeneration-supportive environment in the brain. By inhibiting ODC1 for a 
long period of 3 months in AD mice, we demonstrate that the beneficial 
amyloid-clearing process of astrocytes can be completely segregated from the 
systemically harmful astrocytic response to insult. Our study reports an almost 
complete clearance of Aβ plaques by controlling an endogenous degradation 
process, which also modifies the astrocytic state to create a 
regeneration-supportive environment in the brain. These findings present the 
potential of modulating astrocytic clearance of Aβ as a powerful therapeutic 
strategy against AD.

Primary familial brain calcification (PFBC) is a rare disorder that can manifest 
with a wide spectrum of motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms or even 
remain asymptomatic. Alzheimer disease (AD) is a common condition that typically 
starts as a progressive amnestic disorder and progresses to major cognitive 
impairment. Accurately attributing an etiology to cognitive impairment can 
sometimes be challenging, especially when multiple pathologies with potentially 
overlapping symptomatology contribute to the clinical phenotype. Here, we 
present the case of two patients with autosomal dominant PFBC and non-monogenic 
AD. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker analysis combined with genetic testing 
permitted the dual diagnosis. We emphasize the importance of thoroughly 
characterizing the patient's phenotype at onset and during the follow-up. 
Particular attention is placed on psychiatric symptoms given that both patients 
had a history of mood disorder, a frequent condition in the general population 
and in neurological diseases. We also discuss and challenge the paradigm of 
seeking a single diagnosis explaining all symptoms, remembering the possibility 
of a rare disease co-occurring with a common one.

BACKGROUND: Consistent patterns of reduced cortical thickness have been 
identified in early Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the pathological factors 
that influence rates of cortical thinning within these AD signature regions 
remain unclear.
METHODS: Participants were from the Insight 46 substudy of the MRC National 
Survey of Health and Development (NSHD; 1946 British birth cohort), a 
prospective longitudinal cohort study. Linear regression was used to examine 
associations of baseline cerebral β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, measured using 
florbetapir positron emission tomography, and baseline white matter 
hyperintensity volume (WMHV) on MRI, a marker of cerebral small vessel disease, 
with subsequent longitudinal changes in AD signature cortical thickness 
quantified from baseline and repeat MRI (mean [SD] interval 2.4 [0.2] years).
RESULTS: In a population-based sample of 337 cognitively normal older white 
adults (mean [SD] age at baseline 70.5 [0.6] years; 48.1% female), higher global 
WMHV at baseline related to faster subsequent rates of cortical thinning in both 
AD signature regions (~0.15%/year faster per 10 mL additional WMHV), whereas 
baseline Aβ status did not. Among Aβ positive participants (n=56), there was 
some evidence that greater global Aβ standardised uptake value ratio at baseline 
related to faster cortical thinning in the AD signature Mayo region, but this 
did not reach statistical significance (p=0.08).
CONCLUSIONS: Cortical thinning within AD signature regions may develop via 
cerebrovascular pathways. Perhaps reflecting the age of the cohort and 
relatively low prevalence of Aβ-positivity, robust Aβ-related differences were 
not detected. Longitudinal follow-up incorporating additional biomarkers will 
allow assessment of how these relationships evolve closer to expected dementia 
onset.

INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no 
conclusive remedy. Yohimbine, found in Rauwolfia vomitoria, may reduce brain 
inflammation by targeting tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), implicated in AD 
pathogenesis. Metoserpate, a synthetic compound, may inhibit TNFα. The study is 
aimed at assessing the potential utility of repurposing metoserpate for TNFα 
inhibition to reduce neuronal damage and inflammation in AD. The development of 
safe and effective treatments for AD is crucial to address the growing burden of 
the disease, which is projected to double over the next two decades.
METHODS: Our study repurposed an FDA-approved drug as TNFα inhibitor for AD 
management using structural similarity studies, molecular docking, and molecular 
dynamics simulations. Yohimbine was used as a reference compound. Molecular 
docking used SeeSAR, and molecular dynamics simulation used GROMACS.
RESULTS: Metoserpate was selected from 10 compounds similar to yohimbine based 
on pharmacokinetic properties and FDA approval status. Molecular docking and 
simulation studies showed a stable interaction between metoserpate and TNFα over 
100 ns (100000 ps). This suggests a reliable and robust interaction between the 
protein and ligand, supporting the potential utility of repurposing metoserpate 
for TNFα inhibition in AD treatment.
CONCLUSION: Our study has identified metoserpate, a previously FDA-approved 
antihypertensive agent, as a promising candidate for inhibiting TNFα in the 
management of AD.

BACKGROUND: Epidemiological evidence has demonstrated a clear association 
between diabetes mellitus and increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Cerebral accumulation of phosphorylated tau aggregates, a cardinal 
neuropathological feature of AD, is associated with neurodegeneration and 
cognitive decline. Clinical and experimental studies indicate that diabetes 
mellitus affects the development of tau pathology; however, the underlying 
molecular mechanisms remain unknown.
OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we used a unique diabetic AD mouse model to 
investigate the changes in tau phosphorylation patterns occurring in the 
diabetic brain.
DESIGN: Tau-transgenic mice were fed a high-fat diet (n = 24) to model diabetes 
mellitus. These mice developed prominent obesity, severe insulin resistance, and 
mild hyperglycemia, which led to early-onset neurodegeneration and behavioral 
impairment associated with the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau 
aggregates.
RESULTS: Comprehensive phosphoproteomic analysis revealed a unique tau 
phosphorylation signature in the brains of mice with diabetic AD. Bioinformatic 
analysis of the phosphoproteomics data revealed putative tau-related kinases and 
cell signaling pathways involved in the interaction between diabetes mellitus 
and AD.
CONCLUSION: These findings offer potential novel targets that can be used to 
develop tau-based therapies and biomarkers for use in AD.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging faces inherent challenges when applied to 
deep-brain areas in rodents, e.g. entorhinal cortex, due to the signal loss near 
the ear cavities induced by susceptibility artifacts and reduced sensitivity 
induced by the long distance from the surface array coil. Given the pivotal 
roles of deep brain regions in various diseases, optimized imaging techniques 
are needed. To mitigate susceptibility-induced signal losses, we introduced baby 
cream into the middle ear. To enhance the detection sensitivity of deep brain 
regions, we implemented inductively coupled ear-bars, resulting in approximately 
a 2-fold increase in sensitivity in entorhinal cortex. Notably, the inductively 
coupled ear-bar can be seamlessly integrated as an add-on device, without 
necessitating modifications to the scanner interface. To underscore the 
versatility of inductively coupled ear-bars, we conducted echo-planner 
imaging-based task functional magnetic resonance imaging in rats modeling 
Alzheimer's disease. As a proof of concept, we also demonstrated 
resting-state-functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity maps 
originating from the left entorhinal cortex-a central hub for memory and 
navigation networks-to amygdala hippocampal area, Insular Cortex, Prelimbic 
Systems, Cingulate Cortex, Secondary Visual Cortex, and Motor Cortex. This work 
demonstrates an optimized procedure for acquiring large-scale networks emanating 
from a previously challenging seed region by conventional magnetic resonance 
imaging detectors, thereby facilitating improved observation of functional 
magnetic resonance imaging outcomes.

Post-tetanic Ca2+ release from mitochondria produces presynaptic residual 
calcium, which contributes to post-tetanic potentiation. The loss of 
mitochondria-dependent post-tetanic potentiation is one of the earliest signs of 
Alzheimer's model mice. Post-tetanic potentiation at intracortical synapses of 
medial prefrontal cortex has been implicated in working memory. Although 
mitochondrial contribution to post-tetanic potentiation differs depending on 
synapse types, it is unknown which synapse types express mitochondria-dependent 
post-tetanic potentiation in the medial prefrontal cortex. We studied expression 
of mitochondria-dependent post-tetanic potentiation at different intracortical 
synapses of the rat medial prefrontal cortex. Post-tetanic potentiation occurred 
only at intracortical synapses onto layer 5 corticopontine cells from 
commissural cells and L2/3 pyramidal neurons. Among post-tetanic 
potentiation-expressing synapses, L2/3-corticopontine synapses in the prelimbic 
cortex were unique in that post-tetanic potentiation depends on mitochondria 
because post-tetanic potentiation at corresponding synapse types in other 
cortical areas was independent of mitochondria. Supporting 
mitochondria-dependent post-tetanic potentiation at L2/3-to-corticopontine 
synapses, mitochondria-dependent residual calcium at the axon terminals of L2/3 
pyramidal neurons was significantly larger than that at commissural and 
corticopontine cells. Moreover, post-tetanic potentiation at L2/3-corticopontine 
synapses, but not at commissural-corticopontine synapses, was impaired in the 
young adult Alzheimer's model mice. These results would provide a knowledge base 
for comprehending synaptic mechanisms that underlies the initial clinical signs 
of neurodegenerative disorders.

Exosomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSCs) 
could alleviate Alzheimer's disease (AD) defects. Additionally, engineered 
exosomes are more effective in treating diseases. In this study, we established 
an in vitro model of AD by treating SH-SY5Y cells with Aβ1-40 . We observed that 
incubation with hucMSC-derived exosomes effectively protected SH-S5Y5 cells from 
Aβ1-40 -induced damage. Since NEP plays a central role in suppressing AD 
development, we screened NEP-targeting miRNAs that are differentially expressed 
in control and AD patients. We identified miR-211-5p as a potent repressor of 
NEP expression. Exosomes purified from hucMSCs overexpressing miR-211-5p 
inhibitor exhibited significantly greater efficiency than control exosomes in 
mitigating the injury caused by Aβ1-40 treatment. However, this enhanced 
protective effect was nullified by the knockdown of NEP. These observations 
demonstrate that inhibition of miR-211-5p has the potential to improve the 
efficacy of hucMSC-derived exosomes in AD treatment by increasing NEP 
expression.

Home Utilization Due to a Disease-Modifying Alzheimer's Treatment.

BACKGROUND: A disease-modifying Alzheimer's treatment could provide budgetary 
savings to Canadian provinces from a reduction in long-term care home use, yet 
we do not know the magnitude of those potential savings.
OBJECTIVE: We project savings to each Canadian province's budget from 2023 to 
2043.
DESIGN: Annual savings are projected using a Markov model. We account for 
reduction in long-term care home use and in use of Alternative Level of Care 
(ALC) beds, which are hospital beds occupied by care home-eligible patients on 
the wait list for admission.
RESULTS: A treatment that delays disease progression by 40% is projected to 
avoid 142,507 long-term care home and ALC years, resulting in $17.2 billion 
cumulative savings across all Canadian provinces, a 21% relative reduction among 
treatment eligible patients. Average per capita savings were $1,132, ranging 
from $734 (Alberta) to $2,895 (Prince Edward Island). Cumulative savings could 
increase to $22.7 billion with enhanced triage of patients in primary care 
stages and to $25.6 billion if all capacity constraints for diagnosis and 
treatment were removed.
CONCLUSION: A disease-modifying treatment could create budgetary savings from 
lower long-term care home use, offsetting part of the treatment cost. With the 
increasing demand for long-term care home beds and the high rates of patients 
being held in hospitals while wait-listed, such a treatment could additionally 
provide relief to the overburdened long-term care system in Canada.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive training holds potential as a non-pharmacological 
intervention to decrease cognitive symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), but more research is needed to understand individual differences that may 
predict maximal training benefits.
OBJECTIVE: We conducted a pilot study using a six-month training regimen in 
healthy aging adults with no cognitive decline. We investigated the effects of 
baseline performance and age on training and transfer improvements.
METHODS: Out of 43 participants aged 65-84 years, 31 successfully completed 
cognitive training (BrainHQ) in one of three cognitive domains: processing speed 
(N = 13), inhibitory control (N = 9), or episodic memory (N = 9). We used 
standardized assessments to measure baseline performance and transfer effects.
RESULTS: All 31 participants improved on the cognitive training regimen and age 
was positively associated with training improvement (p = 0.039). The processing 
speed group improved significantly across many near- and far-transfer tasks. In 
the inhibitory control group, individuals with lower baseline performance 
improved more on inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility tasks. In the 
episodic memory group, older individuals improved most on a memory task while 
younger individuals improved most on an executive function far-transfer task.
CONCLUSIONS: Individual differences are predictive of cognitive training gains, 
and the impact of individual differences on training improvements is specific to 
the domain of training. We provide initial insight regarding how 
non-pharmacological interventions can be optimized to combat the onset of 
cognitive decline in older adults. With future research this work can inform the 
design of effective cognitive interventions for delaying cognitive decline in 
preclinical AD.

Comprehensive In Silico Analysis of Uncaria Tomentosa Extract: Chemical 
Profiling, Antioxidant Assessment, and CLASP Protein Interaction for Drug Design 
in Neurodegenerative Diseases.

BACKGROUND: Uncaria tomentosa is a traditional medicinal herb renowned for its 
anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immune-enhancing properties. In the realm of 
neurodegenerative diseases (NDDS), CLASP proteins, responsible for regulating 
microtubule dynamics in neurons, have emerged as critical players. Dysregulation 
of CLASP proteins is associated with NDDS, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and 
Huntington's diseases. Consequently, comprehending the role of CLASP proteins in 
NDDS holds promise for the development of innovative therapeutic interventions.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the research were to identify phytoconstituents in 
the hydroalcoholic extract of Uncaria tomentosa (HEUT), to evaluate its 
antioxidant potential through in vitro free radical scavenging assays and to 
explore its potential interaction with CLASP using in silico molecular docking 
studies.
METHODS: HPLC and LC-MS techniques were used to identify and quantify 
phytochemicals in HEUT. The antioxidant potential was assessed through DPPH, 
ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide (SO) 
free radical scavenging methods. Interactions between conventional quinovic 
acid, chlorogenic acid, epicatechin, corynoxeine, rhynchophylline and syringic 
acid and CLASP were studied through in silico molecular docking using Auto Dock 
4.2.
RESULTS: The HEUT extract demonstrated the highest concentration of quinovic 
acid derivatives. HEUT exhibited strong free radical-scavenging activity with 
IC50 values of 0.113 μg/ml (DPPH) and 9.51 μM (FRAP). It also suppressed NO 
production by 47.1 ± 0.37% at 40 μg/ml and inhibited 77.3 ± 0.69% of SO 
generation. Additionally, molecular docking revealed the potential interaction 
of quinovic acid with CLASP for NDDS.
CONCLUSION: The strong antioxidant potential of HEUT and the interaction of 
quinovic acid with CLASP protein suggest a promising role in treating NDDS 
linked to CLASP protein dysregulation.

Evidence suggests that beta-amyloid (Aβ)-induced phosphorylation/aggregation of 
tau protein plays a critical role in the degeneration of neurons and development 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia affecting the 
elderly population. Many studies have pursued a variety of small molecules, 
including nanoparticles conjugated with drugs to interfere with Aβ and/or tau 
aggregation/toxicity as an effective strategy for AD treatment. We reported 
earlier that FDA approved PLGA nanoparticles without any drug can attenuate Aβ 
aggregation/toxicity in cellular/animal models of AD. In this study, we 
evaluated the effects of native PLGA on Aβ seed-induced aggregation of tau 
protein using a variety of biophysical, structural and spectroscopic approaches. 
Our results show that Aβ1-42 seeds enhanced aggregation of tau protein in the 
presence and absence of heparin and the effect was attenuated by native PLGA 
nanoparticles. Interestingly, PLGA inhibited aggregation of both 4R and 3R tau 
isoforms involved in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles in AD brains. 
Furthermore, Aβ seed-induced tau aggregation in the presence of arachidonic acid 
was suppressed by native PLGA. Collectively, our results suggest that native 
PLGA nanoparticles can inhibit the Aβ seed-induced aggregation of different tau 
protein isoforms highlighting their therapeutic implication in the treatment of 
AD.

BACKGROUND: This study analyzed the extent to which irregularities in genetic 
diversity separate psychiatric patients from healthy controls.
METHODS: Genetic diversity was quantified through multidimensional "gene 
vectors" assembled from 4 to 8 polymorphic SNPs located within each of 100 
candidate genes. The number of different genotypic patterns observed per gene 
was called the gene's "diversity index".
RESULTS: The diversity indices were found to be only weakly correlated with 
their constituent number of SNPs (20.5 % explained variance), thus suggesting 
that genetic diversity is an intrinsic gene property that has evolved over the 
course of evolution. Significant deviations from "normal" diversity values were 
found for (1) major depression; (2) Alzheimer's disease; and (3) schizoaffective 
disorders. Almost one third of the genes were correlated with each other, with 
correlations ranging from 0.0303 to 0.7245. The central finding of this study 
was the discovery of "singular genes" characterized by distinctive genotypic 
patterns that appeared exclusively in patients but not in healthy controls. 
Neural Nets yielded nonlinear classifiers that correctly identified up to 90 % 
of patients. Overlaps between diagnostic subgroups on the genotype level 
suggested that (1) diagnoses-crossing vulnerabilities are likely involved in the 
pathogenesis of major psychiatric disorders; (2) clinically defined diagnoses 
may not constitute etiological entities.
CONCLUSION: Detailed analyses of the variation of genotypic patterns in genes 
along with the correlation between genes lead to nonlinear classifiers that 
enable very robust separation between psychiatric patients and healthy controls 
on the genotype level.

INTRODUCTION: Mapping of microscopic changes in the perivascular space (PVS) of 
the cerebral cortex, beyond magnetic resonance-visible PVS in white matter, may 
enhance our ability to diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD) early.
METHODS: We used the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) water fraction (CSFF), a magnetic 
resonance imaging-based biomarker, to characterize brain parenchymal CSF water, 
reflecting microscopic PVS in parenchyma. We measured CSFF and amyloid beta (Aβ) 
using 11 C Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography to investigate 
their relationship at both the subject and voxel levels.
RESULTS: Our research has demonstrated a positive correlation between the 
parenchymal CSFF, a non-invasive imaging biomarker indicative of parenchymal 
glymphatic clearance, and Aβ deposition, observed at both individual and 
voxel-based assessments in the posterior cingulate cortex.
DISCUSSION: This study shows that an increased parenchymal CSFF is associated 
with Aβ deposition, suggesting that CSFF could serve as a biomarker for brain 
glymphatic clearance, which can be used to detect early fluid changes in PVS 
predisposing individuals to the development of AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Cerebrospinal fluid fraction (CSFF) could be a biomarker of 
parenchymal perivascular space. CSFF is positively associated with amyloid beta 
(Aβ) deposition at subject level. CSFF in an Aβ+ region is higher than in an Aβ- 
region in the posterior cingulate cortex. Correspondence is found between Aβ 
deposition and glymphatic clearance deficits measured by CSFF.

The olfactory working memory capacity (OWMC) paradigm is able to detect 
cognitive deficits in 5XFAD mice (an animal model of Alzheimer's disease [TG]) 
as early as 3 months of age, while other behavioral paradigms detect cognitive 
deficits only at 4-5 months of age. Therefore, we aimed to demonstrate that the 
OWMC paradigm is more sensitive and consistent in the early detection of 
declines in cognitive function than other commonly used behavioral paradigms. 
The prefrontal cortex (PFC), retrosplenial cortex (RSC), subiculum (SUB), and 
amygdala (AMY) of 5XFAD mice were harvested and subjected to immunostaining to 
detect the expression of β-amyloid (Aβ). Additionally, we compared the 
performance of 3-month-old male 5XFAD mice on common behavioral paradigms for 
assessing cognitive function (i.e., the open field [OF] test, novel object 
recognition [NOR] test, novel object location [NOL] test, Y-maze, and Morris 
water maze [MWM]) with that on the OWMC task. In the testing phase of the OWMC 
task, we varied the delay periods to evaluate the working memory capacity (WMC) 
of wild-type (WT) mice. Significant amyloid plaque deposition was observed in 
the PFC, RSC, SUB, and AMY of 3-month-old male 5XFAD mice. However, aside from 
the OWMC task, the other behavioral tests failed to detect cognitive deficits in 
5XFAD mice. Additionally, to demonstrate the efficacy of the OWMC task in 
assessing WMC, we varied the retention delay periods; we found that the WMC of 
WT mice decreased with longer delay periods. The OWMC task is a sensitive and 
robust behavioral assay for detecting changes in cognitive function.

Oxidative stress, hyperactivation of compensatory mechanisms (unfolded protein 
response, UPR; nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, Nrf2) and the 
stimulation of maladaptive response (inflammation/apoptosis) are interconnected 
pathogenic processes occurring during Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. The 
neuroprotective ability of dietary Conjugated linoleic acid (CLAmix) in a mouse 
model of AlCl3-induced AD was recently described but, the effects of AlCl3 or 
CLAmix intake on these pathogenic processes are still unknown. The effects of 
dietary AlCl3 or CLAmix - alone and in combination - were examined in the brain 
cortex of twenty-eight BalbC mice divided into 4 groups (n = 7 each). The 
neurotoxic effects of AlCl3 were investigated in animals treated for 5 weeks 
with 100 mg/kg/day (AL). CLAmix supplementation (600 mg/kg bw/day) for 7 weeks 
(CLA) was aimed at evaluating its modulatory effects on the Nrf2 pathway while 
its co-treatment with AlCl3 during the last 5 weeks of CLAmix intake (CLA + AL) 
was used to investigate its neuroprotective ability. Untreated mice were used as 
controls. In the CLA group, the NADPH oxidase (NOX) activation in the brain 
cortex was accompanied by the modulation of the Nrf2 pathway. By contrast, in 
the AL mice, the significant upregulation of oxidative stress markers, 
compensatory pathways (UPR/Nrf2), proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNFα) and the 
proapoptotic protein Bax levels were found as compared with control. Notably, in 
CLA + AL mice, the marked decrease of oxidative stress, UPR/Nrf2 markers and 
proinflammatory cytokines levels were associated with the significant increase 
of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl2. The involvement of NOX in the adaptive 
response elicited by CLAmix along with its protective effects against the onset 
of several pathogenic processes triggered by AlCl3, broadens the knowledge of 
the mechanism underlying the pleiotropic activity of Nrf2 activators and sheds 
new light on their potential therapeutic use against neurodegenerative 
disorders.

The study aimed to evaluate the potential of piperidine-based 2H chromen-2-one 
derivatives against targeted enzymes, i.e., cholinesterase's and monoamine 
oxidase enzymes. The compounds were divided into three groups, i.e., 4a-m 
((3,4-dimethyl-7-((1-methylpiperidin-4-yl)oxy)-2H-chromen-2-one derivatives), 
5a-e (3,4-dimethyl-7-((1-methypipridin-3-yl)methoxy)-2H-chromen-2-one 
derivatives), and 7a-b 
(7-(3-(3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2(1H)-yl)propoxy)-3,4-dimethyl-2H-chromen-2-one 
derivatives) with slight difference in the basic structure. The comprehensive 
computational investigations were conducted including density functional 
theories studies (DFTs), 2D-QSAR studies, molecular docking, and molecular 
dynamics simulations. The QSAR equation revealed that the activity of selected 
chromen-2-one-based piperidine derivatives is being affected by the six 
descriptors, i.e., Nitrogens Count, SdssCcount, SssOE-Index, T-2-2-7, 
ChiV6chain, and SssCH2E-Index. These descriptor values were further used for the 
preparation of chromen-2-one based piperidine derivatives. Based on this, 83 new 
derivatives were created from 7 selected parent compounds. The QSAR model 
predicted their IC50 values, with compound 4 k and 4kk as the most potent 
multi-targeted derivative. Molecular docking results exhibited these compounds 
as the best inhibitors; however, 4kk exhibited greater activity than the parent 
compounds. The results were further validated by molecular dynamic simulation 
studies along with the suitable physicochemical properties. These results prove 
to be an essential guide for the further design and development of new 
piperidine based chromen-2-one derivatives having better activity against 
neurodegenerative disorder.

Although previous studies have identified human-specific accelerated regions as 
playing a key role in the recent evolution of the human brain, the 
characteristics and cellular functions of rapidly evolving conserved elements 
(RECEs) in ancestral primate lineages remain largely unexplored. Here, based on 
large-scale primate genome assemblies, we identify 888 RECEs that have been 
highly conserved in primates that exhibit significantly accelerated substitution 
rates in the ancestor of the Simiiformes. This primate lineage exhibits 
remarkable morphological innovations, including an expanded brain mass. 
Integrative multiomic analyses reveal that RECEs harbor sequences with potential 
cis-regulatory functions that are activated in the adult human brain. 
Importantly, genes linked to RECEs exhibit pronounced expression trajectories in 
the adult brain relative to the fetal stage. Furthermore, we observed an 
increase in the chromatin accessibility of RECEs in oligodendrocytes from 
individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to that of a control group, 
indicating that these RECEs may contribute to brain aging and AD. Our findings 
serve to expand our knowledge of the genetic underpinnings of brain function 
during primate evolution.

Combining pathological and cognitive tests scores: A novel data analytics 
process to improve dementia prediction models1.

Alshehhi T, Ayesh A, Yang Y, Chen F.

BACKGROUND: The term 'dementia' covers a range of progressive brain diseases 
from which many elderly people suffer. Traditional cognitive and pathological 
tests are currently used to detect dementia, however, applications using 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods have recently shown improved results from 
improved detection accuracy and efficiency.
OBJECTIVE: This research paper investigates the efficacy of one type of data 
analytics called supervised learning to detect Alzheimer's disease (AD) - a 
common dementia condition.
METHODS: The aim is to evaluate cognitive tests and common biological markers 
(biomarkers) such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to develop predictive 
classification systems for dementia detection.
RESULTS: A data analytics process has been proposed, implemented, and tested 
against real data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) repository.
CONCLUSION: The models showed good power in predicting AD levels, notably from 
specified cognitive tests' scores and tauopathy related features.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury has been shown to impose 
deleterious effects not only on the heart but also on the brain. Our previous 
study demonstrated that pretreatment with a mitochondrial fusion promoter (M1) 
provided central neuroprotective effects following cardiac I/R injury.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of M1 given during the ischemic phase and 
M1 given at the beginning of reperfusion on brain pathologies following cardiac 
I/R.
METHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into either a sham operation 
(n = 6) or cardiac I/R injury (n = 18) group. Rats with cardiac I/R injury were 
then randomly divided into 3 subgroups: 1) Control, 2) M1 treatment during 
cardiac ischemia (2 mg/kg, intravenous (i.v.)), and 3) M1 treatment at the 
beginning of reperfusion (2 mg/kg, i.v.). After euthanasia, the brain of each 
rat was removed for further analysis.
RESULTS: Cardiac I/R injury caused brain mitochondrial dynamic imbalance, brain 
mitochondrial dysfunction, brain apoptosis, microglial dysmorphology, brain 
inflammation, tau hyperphosphorylation, and synaptic dysplasticity. M1 treatment 
at both time points effectively improved these parameters. M1 given during the 
ischemic phase had greater efficacy with regard to preventing brain 
mitochondrial dysfunction and suppressing brain inflammation, when compared to 
M1 given at the beginning of reperfusion.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that treatment with this mitochondrial fusion 
promoter prevents mitochondrial dynamic imbalance in the brain of rats with 
cardiac I/R injury, thereby attenuating brain pathologies. Interestingly, giving 
the mitochondrial fusion promoter during the ischemic phase exerted greater 
neuroprotection than if given at the beginning of reperfusion.

Heated tobacco products (HTPs) have emerged as novel alternatives to 
conventional cigarettes (CCs), marketed by the tobacco industry as having a 
reduced potential for harm. Nevertheless, a significant dearth of information 
remains regarding the long-term effects of HTPs on the central nervous system 
(CNS). Here, we sought to shed light on the repercussions of prolonged exposure 
to HTPs on the CNS, employing a mouse model mimicking prodromal Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). Our study entailed subjecting App knock-in mice to 16 weeks of HTP 
exposure, administered 5 days per week, with serum cotinine concentration 
serving as confirmation of HTP exposure within this model. Histological 
analysis, aimed at assessing amyloid pathology, unveiled a minimal impact 
attributable to HTPs. However, exploration of differentially expressed genes in 
the cerebral cortex, using unadjusted p values, indicated an association between 
HTP exposure and non-inflammatory pathways, specifically linked to 
neurohypophyseal and neuropeptide hormone activity within the CNS. Of note, 
similar results have already been observed after exposure to CCs in vivo. Our 
study not only contributes insights into the potential non-inflammatory effects 
of HTPs within the context of AD pathogenesis but also underscores the 
significance of continued research to comprehend the full scope of their impact 
on the CNS.

α-Synuclein is an important drug target for the treatment of Parkinson's disease 
(PD), but it is an intrinsically disordered protein lacking typical 
small-molecule binding pockets. In contrast, the encoding SNCA mRNA has regions 
of ordered structure in its 5' untranslated region (UTR). Here, we present an 
integrated approach to identify small molecules that bind this structured region 
and inhibit α-synuclein translation. A drug-like, RNA-focused compound 
collection was studied for binding to the 5' UTR of SNCA mRNA, affording 
Synucleozid-2.0, a drug-like small molecule that decreases α-synuclein levels by 
inhibiting ribosomes from assembling onto SNCA mRNA. This RNA-binding small 
molecule was converted into a ribonuclease-targeting chimera (RiboTAC) to 
degrade cellular SNCA mRNA. RNA-seq and proteomics studies demonstrated that the 
RiboTAC (Syn-RiboTAC) selectively degraded SNCA mRNA to reduce its protein 
levels, affording a fivefold enhancement of cytoprotective effects as compared 
to Synucleozid-2.0. As observed in many diseases, transcriptome-wide changes in 
RNA expression are observed in PD. Syn-RiboTAC also rescued the expression of 
~50% of genes that were abnormally expressed in dopaminergic neurons 
differentiated from PD patient-derived iPSCs. These studies demonstrate that the 
druggability of the proteome can be expanded greatly by targeting the encoding 
mRNAs with both small molecule binders and RiboTAC degraders.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measures 
neurochemicals in vivo. Glutathione (GSH) is a neuroprotective chemical shown to 
vary significantly in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). This work 
investigates the reproducibility of GSH measures in the mesial temporal lobe 
(MTL) to identify its potential clinical utility.
METHODS: MRS data were acquired from eight healthy volunteers (31.1 ± 5.2 years; 
4 male/female) using Mescher-Garwood-Point Resolved Spectroscopy (MEGA-PRESS) 
from the MTL in the left hemisphere across two scan sessions in the same visit. 
Total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA), choline (tCho), creatine (tCr), and GSH were 
quantified. Reproducibility of quantifications of these neurochemicals were 
tested using coefficient of variance (CV) between scan sessions. Reproducibility 
of voxel placement on the left MTL was calculated by measuring the tissue 
overlap and percent of hippocampus within that voxel. CV measured across 
different scan sessions in each individual, with a CV<15% was accepted as "good" 
reproducibility. Paired t-tests were carried out to establish the significant 
differences between the two scans across each individual with p<.05 as 
significant.
RESULTS: TNAA (%CV = 7.2; p = .5), tCr (%CV = 7.8; p = .6) and tCho (%CV = 9.3; 
p = .4), and GSH (%CV = 22; p = .1). The dice coefficient that reflects the 
level of overlap of hippocampal tissue in the voxel was shown to be 0.8 ± 0.1. 
Voxel tissue composition were: Scan 1 (cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]: 5 ± 1%, white 
matter [WM]: 52 ± 3%, gray matter [GM]: 43 ± 3%); Scan 2 (CSF: 5 ± 1%, WM: 52 ± 
4%, GM: 44 ± 4%).
CONCLUSION: The data suggest measures of abundant metabolites in the MTL using 
the MEGA-PRESS sequence has a high reproducibility. Reproducibility of GSH in 
this area was poorer requiring care when interpreting measures of GSH in the MTL 
for clinical translational purposes.

In extreme environments such as Antarctica, a diverse range of organisms, 
including diatoms, serve as essential reservoirs of distinctive bioactive 
compounds with significant implications in pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical, 
nutraceutical, and biotechnological fields. This is the case of the new species 
Craspedostauros ineffabilis IMA082A and Craspedostauros zucchellii IMA088A 
Trentin, Moschin, Lopes, Custódio and Moro (Bacillariophyta) that are here 
explored for the first time for possible biotechnological applications. For this 
purpose, a bioprospection approach was applied by preparing organic extracts 
(acetone and methanol) from freeze-dried biomass followed by the evaluation of 
their in vitro antioxidant properties and inhibitory activities on enzymes 
related with Alzheimer's disease (acetylcholinesterase: AChE, 
butyrylcholinesterase: BChE), Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM, α-glucosidase, 
α-amylase), obesity (lipase) and hyperpigmentation (tyrosinase). Extracts were 
then profiled by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry 
(UPLC-HR-MS/MS), while the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiles were 
established by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Our results 
highlighted strong copper chelating activity of the acetone extract from C. 
ineffabilis and moderate to high inhibitory activities on AChE, BChE, α-amylase 
and lipase for extracts from both species. The results of the chemical analysis 
indicated polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and their derivatives as the 
possible compounds responsible for the observed activities. The FAME profile 
showed saturated fatty acids (SFA) as the main group and methyl palmitoleate 
(C16:1) as the predominant FAME in both species. Overall, our results suggest 
both Antarctic strains as potential sources of interesting molecules with 
industrial applications. Further studies aiming to investigate unidentified 
metabolites and to maximize growth yield and natural compound production are 
required.

BACKGROUND: Growing evidence suggests that intensive lowering of systolic blood 
pressure (BP) may prevent mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. However, 
current guidelines provide inconsistent recommendations regarding optimal BP 
targets, citing safety concerns of excessive BP lowering in the diverse 
population of older adults. We are conducting a pragmatic trial to determine if 
an implementation strategy to reduce systolic BP to <130 and diastolic BP to 
<80 mmHg will safely slow cognitive decline in older adults with hypertension 
when compared to patients receiving usual care.
METHODS: The Preventing Cognitive Decline by Reducing BP Target Trial (PCOT) is 
an embedded randomized pragmatic clinical trial in 4000 patients from two 
diverse health-systems who are age ≥ 70 years with BP >130/80 mmHg. Participants 
are randomized to the intervention arm or usual care using a permuted block 
randomization within each health system. The intervention is a combination of 
team-based care with clinical decision support to lower home BP to <130/80 mmHg. 
The primary outcome is cognitive decline as determined by the change in the 
modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS-m) scores from baseline. 
As a secondary outcome, patients who decline ≥3 points on the TICS-m will 
complete additional cognitive assessments and this information will be reviewed 
by an expert panel to determine if they meet criteria for MCI or dementia.
CONCLUSION: The PCOT trial will address the effectiveness and safety of 
hypertension treatment in two large health systems to lower BP targets to reduce 
risk of cognitive decline in real-world settings.

BACKGROUND: We examined the relationship between baseline olfactory performance 
and incident significant depressive symptoms and longitudinal depression 
trajectories in well-functioning older adults. Inflammation and cognitive status 
were examined as potential mediators.
METHODS: Older adults (n = 2 125, 71-82 years, 51% female, 37% Black) completed 
an odor identification task at Year 3 (our study baseline) of the Health, Aging, 
and Body Composition study. Cognitive assessments, depressive symptoms, and 
inflammatory markers were ascertained across multiple visits over 8 years. 
Discrete-time complementary log-log models, group-based trajectory models, and 
multivariable-adjusted multinomial logistic regression were employed to assess 
the relationship between baseline olfaction and incident depression and 
longitudinal depression trajectories. Mediation analysis assessed the influence 
of cognitive status on these relationships.
RESULTS: Individuals with lower olfaction had an increased risk of developing 
significant depressive symptoms at follow-up (hazard ratio = 1.04, 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 1.00, 1.08). Of the 3 patterns of longitudinal 
depression scores identified (stable low, stable moderate, and stable high), 
poorer olfaction was associated with a 6% higher risk of membership in the 
stable moderate (relative risk ratio [RRR] = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.10)/stable 
high (RRR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.12) groups, compared to the stable low group. 
Poor cognitive status, but not inflammation, partially mediated the relationship 
between olfactory performance and incident depression symptom severity.
CONCLUSIONS: Suboptimal olfaction could serve as a prognostic indicator of 
vulnerability for the development of late-life depression. These findings 
underscore the need for a greater understanding of olfaction in late-life 
depression and the demographic, cognitive, and biological factors that influence 
these relationships over time.

BACKGROUND: Little information is available on the prevalence of cognitive 
impairment in Mexican American persons.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 
dementia in those 65 years and older among Mexican American and non-Hispanic 
white individuals in a community.
METHODS: This was a population-based cohort study in Nueces County, Texas, USA. 
Participants were recruited using a random housing sample. The Harmonized 
Cognitive Assessment (HCAP) participant and informant protocol was performed 
after Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) screening. An algorithm was used to 
sort participants into diagnostic categories: no cognitive impairment, MCI, or 
dementia. Logistic regression determined the association of ethnicity with MCI 
and dementia controlling for age, gender, and education.
RESULTS: 1,901 participants completed the MoCA and 547 the HCAP. Mexican 
Americans were younger and had less educational attainment than non-Hispanic 
whites. Overall, dementia prevalence was 11.6% (95% CI 9.2-14.0) and MCI 
prevalence was 21.2% (95% CI 17.5-24.8). After adjusting for age, gender, and 
education level, there was no significant ethnic difference in the odds of 
dementia or MCI. Those with ≤11 compared with ≥16 years of education had much 
higher dementia [OR = 4.9 (95% CI 2.2-11.1)] and MCI risk [OR = 3.5 (95% CI 
1.6-7.5)].
CONCLUSIONS: Dementia and MCI prevalence were high in both Mexican American and 
non-Hispanic white populations. Mexican American persons had double the odds of 
mild cognitive impairment and this was attenuated when age and educational 
attainment were considered. Educational attainment was a potent predictor of 
cognitive impairment.

BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, 
Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's disease, present significant 
challenges for therapeutic development due to drug delivery restrictions and 
toxicity concerns. Prevailing strategies often employ adeno-associated viral 
(AAV) vectors to deliver neuroprotective survival genes directly into the 
central nervous system (CNS). However, these methods have been limited by 
triggering immunogenic responses and risk of tumorigenicity, resulting from 
overexpression of survival genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), 
thereby increasing the risk of tumorigenicity in specific immune cells. Thus, by 
coding selectively suppressive microRNA (miRNA) target sequences in AAV genome, 
we designed CNS-targeted neuroprotective gene expression vector system without 
leakage to blood cells.
METHODS: To minimize the potential for transgene contamination in the blood, we 
designed a CNS-specific AAV system. Our system utilized a self-complementary AAV 
(scAAV), encoding a quadruple repeated target sequence of the hematopoietic 
cell-specific miR142-3p at the 3' untranslated region (UTR). As a representative 
therapeutic survival gene for Parkinson's disease treatment, we integrated DX2, 
an antagonistic splice variant of the apoptotic gene AIMP2, known to be 
implicated in Parkinson's disease, into the vector.
RESULTS: This configuration ensured that transgene expression was stringently 
localized to the CNS, even if the vector found its way into the blood cells. A 
single injection of scAAV-DX2 demonstrated marked improvement in behavior and 
motor activity in animal models of Parkinson's disease induced by either 
Rotenone or 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Importantly, 
comprehensive preclinical data adhering to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) 
standards revealed no adverse effects in the treated animals.
CONCLUSIONS: Our CNS-specific vector system, which encodes a survival transgene 
DX2, signifies a promising avenue for safe gene therapy, avoiding unintended 
expression of survival gene in blood cells, applicable to various 
neurodegenerative diseases.

BACKGROUND: The potential neuroprotective effects of regular physical activity 
on brain structure are unclear, despite links between activity and reduced 
dementia risk.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationships between regular moderate to vigorous 
physical activity and quantified brain volumes on magnetic resonance 
neuroimaging.
METHODS: A total of 10,125 healthy participants underwent whole-body MRI scans, 
with brain sequences including isotropic MP-RAGE. Three deep learning models 
analyzed axial, sagittal, and coronal views from the scans. Moderate to vigorous 
physical activity, defined by activities increasing respiration and pulse rate 
for at least 10 continuous minutes, was modeled with brain volumes via partial 
correlations. Analyses adjusted for age, sex, and total intracranial volume, and 
a 5% Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate addressed multiple comparisons.
RESULTS: Participant average age was 52.98±13.04 years (range 18-97) and 52.3% 
were biologically male. Of these, 7,606 (75.1%) reported engaging in moderate or 
vigorous physical activity approximately 4.05±3.43 days per week. Those with 
vigorous activity were slightly younger (p < 0.00001), and fewer women compared 
to men engaged in such activities (p = 3.76e-15). Adjusting for age, sex, body 
mass index, and multiple comparisons, increased days of moderate to vigorous 
activity correlated with larger normalized brain volumes in multiple regions 
including: total gray matter (Partial R = 0.05, p = 1.22e-7), white matter 
(Partial R = 0.06, p = 9.34e-11), hippocampus (Partial R = 0.05, p = 5.96e-7), 
and frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes (Partial R = 0.04, p≤1.06e-5).
CONCLUSIONS: Exercise-related physical activity is associated with increased 
brain volumes, indicating potential neuroprotective effects.

Synapse loss is the principal cause of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) and related disorders (ADRD). Synapse development depends on the intricate 
dynamics of the neuronal cytoskeleton. Cofilin, the major protein regulating 
actin dynamics, can be sequestered into cofilactin rods, intra-neurite bundles 
of cofilin-saturated actin filaments that can disrupt vesicular trafficking and 
cause synaptic loss. Rods are a brain pathology in human AD and mouse models of 
AD and ADRD. Eliminating rods is the focus of this paper. One pathway for rod 
formation is triggered in ~20% of rodent hippocampal neurons by disease-related 
factors (e.g., soluble oligomers of Amyloid-β (Aβ)) and requires cellular prion 
protein (PrPC), active NADPH oxidase (NOX), and cytokine/chemokine receptors 
(CCRs). FDA-approved antagonists of CXCR4 and CCR5 inhibit Aβ-induced rods in 
both rodent and human neurons with effective concentrations for 50% rod 
reduction (EC50) of 1-10 nM. Remarkably, two D-amino acid receptor-active 
peptides (RAP-103 and RAP-310) inhibit Aβ-induced rods with an EC50 of ~1 pM in 
mouse neurons and ~0.1 pM in human neurons. These peptides are analogs of 
D-Ala-Peptide T-Amide (DAPTA) and share a pentapeptide sequence (TTNYT) 
antagonistic to several CCR-dependent responses. RAP-103 does not inhibit 
neuritogenesis or outgrowth even at 1 µM, >106-fold above its EC50. N-terminal 
methylation, or D-Thr to D-Ser substitution, decreases the rod-inhibiting 
potency of RAP-103 by 103-fold, suggesting high target specificity. Neither RAP 
peptide inhibits neuronal rod formation induced by excitotoxic glutamate, but 
both inhibit rods induced in human neurons by several PrPC/NOX pathway 
activators (Aβ, HIV-gp120 protein, and IL-6). Significantly, RAP-103 completely 
protects against Aβ-induced loss of mature and developing synapses and, at 0.1 
nM, reverses rods in both rodent and human neurons (T½ ~ 3 h) even in the 
continuous presence of Aβ. Thus, this orally available, brain-permeable peptide 
should be highly effective in reducing rod pathology in multifactorial 
neurological diseases with mixed proteinopathies acting through PrPC/NOX.

IMPORTANCE: Modifiable risk factors are hypothesized to account for 30% to 40% 
of dementia; yet, few trials have demonstrated that risk-reduction 
interventions, especially multidomain, are efficacious.
OBJECTIVE: To determine if a personalized, multidomain risk reduction 
intervention improves cognition and dementia risk profile among older adults.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Systematic Multi-Domain Alzheimer Risk 
Reduction Trial was a randomized clinical trial with a 2-year personalized, 
risk-reduction intervention. A total of 172 adults at elevated risk for dementia 
(age 70-89 years and with ≥2 of 8 targeted risk factors) were recruited from 
primary care clinics associated with Kaiser Permanente Washington. Data were 
collected from August 2018 to August 2022 and analyzed from October 2022 to 
September 2023.
INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention 
(personalized risk-reduction goals with health coaching and nurse visits) or to 
a health education control.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was change in a composite 
modified Neuropsychological Test Battery; preplanned secondary outcomes were 
change in risk factors and quality of life (QOL). Outcomes were assessed at 
baseline and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Linear mixed models were used to compare, 
by intention to treat, average treatment effects (ATEs) from baseline over 
follow-up. The intervention and outcomes were initially in person but then, due 
to onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, were remote.
RESULTS: The 172 total participants had a mean (SD) age of 75.7 (4.8) years, and 
108 (62.8%) were women. After 2 years, compared with the 90 participants in the 
control group, the 82 participants assigned to intervention demonstrated larger 
improvements in the composite cognitive score (ATE of SD, 0.14; 95% CI, 
0.03-0.25; P = .02; a 74% improvement compared with the change in the control 
group), better composite risk factor score (ATE of SD, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.01-0.20; 
P = .03), and improved QOL (ATE, 0.81 points; 95% CI, -0.21 to 1.84; P = .12). 
There were no between-group differences in serious adverse events (24 in the 
intervention group and 23 in the control group; P = .59), but the intervention 
group had greater treatment-related adverse events such as musculoskeletal pain 
(14 in the intervention group vs 0 in the control group; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, a 2-year, 
personalized, multidomain intervention led to modest improvements in cognition, 
dementia risk factors, and QOL. Modifiable risk-reduction strategies should be 
considered for older adults at risk for dementia.
