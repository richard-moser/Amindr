      <td>The aim of our study was to investigate regional glucose metabolism with 18F-FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography in a population of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in relation to cerebrospinal (CSF) levels of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT). All patients underwent lumbar puncture and received a biomarker-based diagnosis of AD. Differences in regional brain glucose metabolism were assessed by Statistical Parametric Mapping version 12 with the use of age, gender, and MMSE as covariates in the analysis. A positive correlation between CSF DAT levels and glucose metabolism at the level of two brain areas involved in the pathophysiological process of Alzheimer’s disease, the substantia nigra and the posterior cingulate gyrus, has been highlighted. Results indicate that patients with higher CSF DAT levels have a better metabolic pattern in two key zones, suggesting less advanced disease status in patients with more conserved dopaminergic systems.</td>

      <td>Tauopathies, including Alzheimer’s disease, are characterized by retinal ganglion cell loss associated with amyloid and phosphorylated tau deposits. We investigated the functional impact of these histopathological alterations in the murine P301S model of tauopathy. Visual impairments were demonstrated by a decrease in visual acuity already detectable at 6 months, the onset of disease. Visual signals to the cortex and retina were delayed at 6 and 9 months, respectively. Surprisingly, the retinal output signal was delayed at the light onset and advanced at the light offset. This antagonistic effect, due to a dysfunction of the cone photoreceptor synapse, was associated with changes in the expression of the vesicular glutamate transporter and a microglial reaction. This dysfunction of retinal glutamatergic synapses suggests a novel interpretation for visual deficits in tauopathies and it highlights the potential value of the retina for the diagnostic assessment and the evaluation of therapies in Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopathies.</td>

      <td>Background and Purpose Tau deposition in the entorhinal cortex is the earliest pathological feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, this feature has also been observed in cognitively normal (CN) individuals and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The precise pathophysiology for the development of tau deposition remains unclear. We hypothesized that reduced cerebral perfusion is associated with the development of tau deposition. MethodsA subset of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data set was utilized. Included patients had undergone arterial spin labeling perfusion MRI along with [18F]flortaucipir tau PET at baseline, within 1 year of the MRI, and a follow-up at 6 years. The association between baseline cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the baseline and 6-year tau PET was assessed. Univariate and multivariate linear modeling was performed, with p&lt;0.05 indicating significance.ResultsSignificant differences were found in the CBF between patients with AD and MCI, and CN individuals in the left entorhinal cortex (p=0.013), but not in the right entorhinal cortex (p=0.076). The difference in maximum standardized uptake value ratio between 6 years and baseline was significantly and inversely associated with the baseline mean CBF (p=0.042, R2=0.54) in the left entorhinal cortex but not the right entorhinal cortex. Linear modeling demonstrated that CBF predicted 6-year tau deposition (p=0.015, R2=0.11).ConclusionsThe results of this study suggest that a reduction in CBF at the entorhinal cortex precedes tau deposition. Further work is needed to understand the mechanism underlying tau deposition in aging and disease.</td>

      <td>Tau protein aggregates are a major driver of neurodegeneration and behavioral impairments in tauopathies, including in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), the highest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD, has been shown to exacerbate tau hyperphosphorylation in mouse models. However, the exact mechanisms through which APOE4 induces tau hyperphosphorylation remains unknown. Here, we report that the astrocyte-secreted protein glypican-4 (GPC-4), which we identify as a binding partner of APOE4, drives tau hyperphosphorylation. We discovered that first, GPC-4 preferentially interacts with APOE4 in comparison to APOE2, considered to be a protective allele to AD, and second, that postmortem APOE4-carrying AD brains highly express GPC-4 in neurotoxic astrocytes. Furthermore, the astrocyte-secreted GPC-4 induced both tau accumulation and propagation in vitro. CRISPR/dCas9-mediated activation of GPC-4 in a tauopathy mouse model robustly induced tau hyperphosphorylation. In the absence of GPC4, APOE4-induced tau hyperphosphorylation was largely diminished using in vitro tau fluorescence resonance energy transfer-biosensor cells, in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes and in an in vivo mouse model. We further show that APOE4-mediated surface trafficking of APOE receptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 through GPC-4 can be a gateway to tau spreading. Collectively, these data support that APOE4-induced tau hyperphosphorylation is directly mediated by GPC-4.</td>

      <td>Alteration of the levels, localization or post-translational processing of the microtubule associated protein Tau is associated with many neurodegenerative disorders. Here we develop adult-onset models for human Tau (hTau) toxicity in Drosophila that enable age-dependent quantitative measurement of central nervous system synapse loss and axonal degeneration, in addition to effects upon lifespan, to facilitate evaluation of factors that may contribute to Tau-dependent neurodegeneration. Using these models, we interrogate the interaction of hTau with the retromer complex, an evolutionarily conserved cargo-sorting protein assembly, whose reduced activity has been associated with both Parkinson’s and late onset Alzheimer’s disease. We reveal that reduction of retromer activity induces a potent enhancement of hTau toxicity upon synapse loss, axon retraction and lifespan through a specific increase in the production of a C-terminal truncated isoform of hTau. Our data establish a molecular and subcellular mechanism necessary and sufficient for the depletion of retromer activity to exacerbate Tau-dependent neurodegeneration.</td>

      <td>The formation of amyloid-ß peptides (Aß), that accumulate in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brains, involves proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) firstly by ß-secretase (BACE1). Since BACE1 cleaves a plethora of other substrates, in this work we investigated whether the proteolysis and/or distribution of other BACE1 substrates, such as seizure protein 6 (Sez6) and seizure 6-like protein (Sez6L), is altered in AD. To test this we used 5xFAD mouse model brains that show an early accumulation of Aß plaques already at 2-months of age. Here we show for the first time that accumulation of BACE1 in peri-plaque regions and its enhanced levels in AD brains does not affect proteolysis of BACE1 substrates other than APP, such as Sez6 and Sez6L. We observed altered distribution of Sez6 and Sez6L in the area of Aß plaques in 5xFAD brains which is distinct to that of APP, BACE1 and/or LAMP1, suggesting different localization and/or function of these BACE1 substrates. While it is necessary to further elucidate the potential role that this may play in the course of AD, it is likely that Aß-targeted therapies may have beneficial effects against accumulation and/or altered distribution of BACE1 and its substrates, in addition to APP.</td>

      <td>In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the reduction in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzymatic activity is not paralleled with changes in its protein levels, suggesting the presence of a considerable enzymatically inactive pool in the brain. In the present study, we validated previous findings, and, since inactive forms could result from post-translational modifications, we analyzed the glycosylation of AChE by lectin binding in brain samples from sporadic and familial AD (sAD and fAD). Most of the enzymatically active AChE was bound to lectins Canavalia ensiformis (Con A) and Lens culinaris agglutinin (LCA) that recognize terminal mannoses, whereas Western blot assays showed a very low percentage of AChE protein being recognized by the lectin. This indicates that active and inactive forms of AChE vary in their glycosylation pattern, particularly in the presence of terminal mannoses in active ones. Moreover, sAD subjects showed reduced binding to terminal mannoses compared to non-demented controls, while, for fAD patients that carry mutations in the PSEN1 gene, the binding was higher. The role of presenilin-1 (PS1) in modulating AChE glycosylation was then studied in a cellular model that overexpresses PS1 (CHO-PS1). In CHO-PS1 cells, binding to LCA indicates that AChE displays more terminal mannoses in oligosaccharides with a fucosylated core. Immunocytochemical assays also demonstrated increased presence of AChE in the trans-Golgi. Moreover, AChE enzymatic activity was higher in plasmatic membrane of CHO-PS1 cells. Thus, our results indicate that PS1 modulates trafficking and maturation of AChE in Golgi regions favoring the presence of active forms in the membrane.</td>

      <td>A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease 10, also known as ADAM10, is a cell surface protease ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells where it cuts several membrane proteins implicated in multiple physiological processes. The dysregulation of ADAM10 expression and function has been implicated in pathological conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Although it has been suggested that ADAM10 is expressed as a zymogen and the removal of the prodomain results in its activation, other potential mechanisms for the ADAM10 proteolytic function and activation remain unclear. Another suggested mechanism is post-translational modification of the cytoplasmic domain, which regulates ADAM10-dependent protein ectodomain shedding. Therefore, the precise and temporal activation of ADAM10 is highly desirable to reveal the fine details of ADAM10-mediated cleavage mechanisms and protease-dependent therapeutic applications. Here, we present a strategy to control prodomain and cytosolic tail cleavage to regulate ADAM10 shedding activity without the intervention of small endogenous molecule signaling pathways. We generated a series of engineered ADAM10 analogs containing Tobacco Etch Virus protease (TEV) cleavage site (TEVcs), rendering ADAM10 cleavable by TEV. This strategy revealed that, in the absence of other stimuli, the TEV-mediated removal of the prodomain could not activate ADAM10. However, the TEV-mediated cleavage of the cytosolic domain significantly increased ADAM10 activity. Then, we generated ADAM10 with a minimal constitutively catalytic activity that increased significantly in the presence of TEV or after activating a chemically activatable TEV. Our results revealed a bioengineering strategy for controlling the ADAM10 activity in living cells, paving the way to obtain spatiotemporal control of ADAM10. Finally, we proved that our approach of controlling ADAM10 promoted α-secretase activity and the non-amyloidogenic cleavage of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP), thereby increasing the production of the neuroprotective soluble ectodomain (sAPPα). Our bioengineering strategy has the potential to be exploited as a next-generation gene therapy for AD.</td>

Maternal HFD also altered the expression of genes regulating amyloid-β-protein (Aβ) metabolism (i.e., Bace1, Ern1, Ide and Nicastrin) and enhanced Aβ deposition in the hippocampus. Finally, we found an epigenetic derangement and an aberrant recruitment of transcription factors NF-kB and STAT3 and chromatin remodeler HDAC2 on the regulatory sequences of the same genes.

In transgenic amyloid mouse models, serotonin degeneration is detected prior to widespread cortical beta-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, also suggesting that serotonin degeneration may be observed in preclinical AD. Methods The differences in the distribution of serotonin degeneration (reflected by the loss of the serotonin transporter, 5-HTT) relative to Aβ deposition was measured with positron emission tomography in a group of individuals with MCI and a group of healthy older adults. A multi-modal partial least squares (mmPLS) algorithm was applied to identify the spatial covariance pattern between 5-HTT availability and Aβ deposition. Results Forty-five individuals with MCI and 35 healthy older adults were studied, 22 and 27 of whom were included in the analyses who were “amyloid positive” and “amyloid negative”, respectively. A pattern of lower cortical, subcortical and limbic 5-HTT availability and higher cortical Aβ deposition distinguished the MCI from the healthy older control participants. Greater expression of this pattern was correlated with greater deficits in memory and executive function in the MCI group, not in the control group.ConclusionA spatial covariance pattern of lower 5-HTT availability and Aβ deposition was observed to a greater extent in an MCI group relative to a control group and was associated with cognitive impairment in the MCI group. The results support the application of mmPLS to understand the neurochemical changes associated with Aβ deposition in the course of preclinical AD.</td>

      <td>Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with the deposition of misfolded aggregates of the amyloid-β protein (Aβ). Aβ(1–42) is one of the most aggregation-prone components in senile plaques of AD patients. We demonstrated that relatively homogeneous Aβ(1–42) fibrils with one predominant fold visible in solid-state NMR spectra can be obtained at acidic pH. The structure of these fibrils differs remarkably from some other polymorphs obtained at neutral pH. In particular, the entire N-terminal region is part of the rigid fibril core. Here, we investigate the effects of a pH shift on the stability and the fold of these fibrils at higher pH values. Fibril bundling at neutral pH values renders cryo-EM studies impractical, but solid-state NMR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and biophysical methods provide residue-specific structural information under these conditions. The LS-fold of the Aβ(1–42) fibrils does not change over the complete pH range from pH 2 to pH 7; in particular, the N-terminus remains part of the fibril core. We observe changes in the protonation state of charged residues starting from pH 5 on a residue-specific level. The deprotonation of the C-terminal carboxyl group of A42 in the intermolecular salt bridge with D1 and K28 is slow on the NMR time scale, with a local pKa of 5.4, and local conformations of the involved residues are affected by deprotonation of A42. Thus, we demonstrate that this fibril form is stable at physiological pH values.</td>

      <td>While soluble forms of amyloid-β (Aβ) and Tau work together to drive healthy neurons into a disease state, how their interaction may control the prion-like propagation and neurotoxicity of Tau is not fully understood. The cross-linking via disulfide bond formation is crucial for Tau oligomers to obtain stable conformers and spread between cells. This work thus focuses on how Aβ42 regulates this critical process. By studying the interactions between Aβ42 and TauPHF43, a construct that mimics the Tau R3 isoform, has a similar length to Aβ42, and contains one cysteine (Cys-322), we discovered that fresh Aβ42 could protect Tau against the formation of disulfide cross-linked dimers. We showed that the monomeric and small Aβ oligomers (the “nonamyloidogenic Aβ”) efficiently disassembled tau dimers and heparin-induced Tau oligomers to recover Tau monomers. Interestingly, Aβ serves the role of an antioxidant to prevent disulfide bond formation, as supported by the experiments of Aβ with cystine. Furthermore, using cyclosporine A (CycA), a macrocyclic β-sheet disruptor, we demonstrated that targeting amyloidogenic Aβ with CycA does not affect the TauPHF43 disassembly driven by Aβ42. Separately, we assessed the initial toxicity of Aβ42 and TauPHF43 in acute brain slices and found that Aβ42 is more toxic than TauPHF43 or the two peptides combined. Our work highlights a potential protective role of Aβ42 monomers in AD that was previously overlooked while focusing on the mechanism behind Aβ42 aggregation leading to tau dysfunction.</td>

Intra-intestinal injection of isotope or fluorescence labeled Aβ combined with vagotomy was also performed to investigate the transmission of Aβ from gut to brain. The data showed that, in aged mice, the gut Aβ42 was transported to the brain mainly via blood rather than the vagal nerve.

Determined air pollutants include particulate matter &lt;10μm (PM10) and &lt;2.5μm (PM2.5), a proxy of elemental carbon (PM2.5 absorbance), nitrogen oxide (NOx), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). As the individual air pollutant levels were highly correlated (r = 0.71-0.98),we computed a general marker covering all air pollutants based on a principal component analysis. We followed participants up for dementia until 2018 anddetermined cognitive performance during two subsequent examination rounds. Using Cox and linear mixed models, we related air pollution to dementia and cognitive decline.RESULTS: Of the 7,511 non-demented participants at baseline, 545 developed dementia during a median follow-up of 7 years. The general marker of all air pollutants was not associated with the risk of dementia (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.04 [0.95-1.15]), neither were the individual air pollutants. Also, the general marker of all air pollutants or the individual air pollutant levels were not associated with cognitive decline.

We aimed to evaluate the natural history of tau accumulation, and the impact of disease stage and reference region on the magnitude and effect size of regional change.METHODS: One hundred and eighty-four participants: 89 cognitively unimpaired (CU) beta-amyloid negative (Aβ-), 44 CU Aβ+, 51cognitively impaired Aβ+ (26 with mild cognitive impairment [MCI] and 25 with dementia) had follow-up 18F-MK6240 PET for one to four years (median 1.48). Regional standardised uptake value ratios (SUVR) were generated. Two reference regions were examined: cerebellar cortex and eroded subcortical white matter.FINDINGS: CU Aβ- participants had very low rates of tau accumulation in the mesial temporal lobe (MTL). In CU Aβ+, significantly higher rate of accumulation was seen in the MTL (particularly the amygdala), extending into the inferior temporal lobes. In MCI Aβ+, the rate of accumulation was greatest in the lateral temporal, parietal and lateral occipital cortex, and plateaued in the MTL. Accumulation was global in AD Aβ+, except for a plateau in the MTL. The eroded subcortical white matter reference region showed no significant advantage over the cerebellar cortex and appeared prone to spill-over in AD participants. Data fitting suggested approximately 15-20 years to accumulate tau to typical AD levels.INTERPRETATION: Tau accumulation occurs slowly. Rates vary according to brain region, disease stage and tend to plateau at high levels. Rates of tau accumulation are best measured in the MTL and inferior temporal cortex in preclinical AD and in large neocortical areas, in MCI and AD. FUNDING: NHMRC; Cerveau Technologies.</td>
