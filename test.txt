OBJECTIVE: Early synchrony alterations have been observed through 
electrophysiological techniques in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), which is 
considered the intermediate phase between healthy aging (HC) and Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). However, the documented direction (hyper/hypo-synchronization), 
regions and frequency bands affected are inconsistent. This meta-analysis 
intended to elucidate existing evidence linked to potential neurophysiological 
biomarkers of AD.
METHODS: We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis that entailed the unbiased 
inclusion of Non-statistically Significant Unreported Effect Sizes ("MetaNSUE") 
of electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetoencephalogram (MEG) studies 
investigating functional connectivity changes at rest along the 
healthy-pathological aging continuum, searched through PubMed, Scopus, Web of 
Science and PsycINFO databases until June 2023.
RESULTS: Of the 3852 articles extracted, we analyzed 12 papers, and we found an 
alpha synchrony decrease in MCI compared to HC, specifically between 
temporal-parietal (d = -0.26) and frontal-parietal areas (d = -0.25).
CONCLUSIONS: Alterations of alpha synchrony are present even at MCI stage.
SIGNIFICANCE: Synchrony measures may be promising for the detection of the first 
hallmarks of connectivity alterations, even at the prodromal stages of the AD, 
before clinical symptoms occur.
