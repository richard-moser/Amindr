      <td>Ultrasound Blood-Brain Barrier Opening and Aducanumab in Alzheimer's Disease.</td>
      <td>Antiamyloid antibodies have been used to reduce cerebral amyloid-beta (Aβ) load  in patients with Alzheimer's disease. We applied focused ultrasound with each of  six monthly aducanumab infusions to temporarily open the blood-brain barrier  with the goal of enhancing amyloid removal in selected brain regions in three  participants over a period of 6 months. The reduction in the level of Aβ was  numerically greater in regions treated with focused ultrasound than in the  homologous regions in the contralateral hemisphere that were not treated with  focused ultrasound, as measured by fluorine-18 florbetaben positron-emission  tomography. Cognitive tests and safety evaluations were conducted over a period  of 30 to 180 days after treatment. (Funded by the Harry T.

      <td>Soluble TREM2 triggers microglial dysfunction in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders.</td>
      <td>Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation contributes to acute demyelination in  neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD). Soluble triggering receptor  expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2) in the CSF has been associated with  microglial activation in several neurodegenerative diseases. However, the basis  for this immune-mediated attack and the pathophysiological role of sTREM2 in  NMOSD remain to be elucidated. Here, we performed Mendelian randomization  analysis and identified a genetic association between increased CSF sTREM2 and  NMOSD risk. CSF sTREM2 was elevated in patients with NMOSD and was positively  correlated with neural injury and other neuroinflammation markers. Single-cell  RNA sequencing of human macrophage/microglia-like cells in CSF, a proxy for  microglia, showed that increased CSF sTREM2 was positively associated with  microglial dysfunction in patients with NMOSD. Furthermore, we demonstrated that  sTREM2 is a reliable biomarker of microglial activation in a mouse model of  NMOSD. Using unbiased transcriptomic and lipidomic screens, we identified that  excessive activation, overwhelmed phagocytosis of myelin debris, suppressed  lipid metabolism and enhanced glycolysis underlie sTREM2-mediated microglial  dysfunction, possibly through the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signalling  pathway. These molecular and cellular findings provide a mechanistic explanation  for the genetic association between CSF sTREM2 and NMOSD risk and indicate that  sTREM2 could be a potential biomarker of NMOSD progression and a therapeutic  target for microglia-mediated neuroinflammation.</td>

      <td>Neurotrophic Natural Products.</td>
      <td>Neurotrophins (NGF, BDNF, NT3, NT4) can decrease cell death, induce  differentiation, as well as sustain the structure and function of neurons, which  make them promising therapeutic agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative  disorders. However, neurotrophins have not been very effective in clinical  trials mostly because they cannot pass through the blood-brain barrier owing to  being high-molecular-weight proteins. Thus, neurotrophin-mimic small molecules,  which stimulate the synthesis of endogenous neurotrophins or enhance  neurotrophic actions, may serve as promising alternatives to neurotrophins.  Small-molecular-weight natural products, which have been used in dietary  functional foods or in traditional medicines over the course of human history,  have a great potential for the development of new therapeutic agents against  neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. In this contribution, a  variety of natural products possessing neurotrophic properties such as  neurogenesis, neurite outgrowth promotion (neuritogenesis), and neuroprotection  are described, and a focus is made on the chemistry and biology of several  neurotrophic natural products.</td>

      <td>Gut microbiota, circulating cytokines and dementia: a Mendelian randomization study.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Some studies have shown that gut microbiota may be associated with  dementia. However, the causal effects between gut microbiota and different types  of dementia and whether cytokines act as a mediator remain unclear. METHODS: Gut microbiota, cytokines, and five dementia types, including  Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia with Lewy body  (DLB), vascular dementia (VD), and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) were  identified from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary data.  We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causal relationships  between gut microbiota, cytokines, and five types of dementia. Inverse variance  weighting (IVW) was used as the main statistical method. In addition, we  explored whether cytokines act as a mediating factor in the pathway from gut  microbiota to dementia. RESULTS: There were 20 positive and 16 negative causal effects between genetic  liability in the gut microbiota and dementia. Also, there were five positive and  four negative causal effects between cytokines and dementias. Cytokines did not  act as mediating factors. CONCLUSIONS: Gut microbiota and cytokines were causally associated with five  types of dementia, and cytokines seemed not to be the mediating factors in the  pathway from gut microbiota to dementia.</td>

      <td>Patient and Family Outcomes of Community Neurologist Palliative Education and Telehealth Support in Parkinson Disease.</td>
      <td>IMPORTANCE: Parkinson disease and related disorders (PDRD) are the fastest  growing neurodegenerative illness in terms of prevalence and mortality. As  evidence builds to support palliative care (PC) for PDRD, studies are needed to  guide implementation. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether PC training for neurologists and remote access  to a PC team improves outcomes in patients with PDRD in community settings. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This pragmatic, stepped-wedge comparative  effectiveness trial enrolled and observed participants from 19 community  neurology practices supported by PC teams at 2 academic centers from March 8,  2017, to December 31, 2020. Participants were eligible if they had PDRD and  moderate to high PC needs. A total of 612 persons with PDRD were referred; 253  were excluded. Patients were excluded if they had another diagnosis meriting PC,  were receiving PC, or were unable or unwilling to follow study procedures.  Patients received usual care or the intervention based on when their community  neurologist was randomized to start the intervention. Data were analyzed from  January 2021 to September 2023. INTERVENTION: The intervention included (1) PC education for community  neurologists and (2) team-based PC support via telehealth. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were differences at 6 months in  patient quality of life (QOL; measured by the Quality of Life in Alzheimer  Disease Scale [QOL-AD]) and caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Interview) between  the intervention and usual care. RESULTS: A total of 359 patients with PDRD (233 men [64.9%]; mean [SD] age, 74.0  [8.8] years) and 300 caregivers were enrolled. At 6 months, compared with usual  care, participants receiving the intervention had better QOL (QOL-AD score, 0.09  [95% CI, -0.63 to 0.82] vs -0.88 [95% CI, -1.62 to -0.13]; treatment effect  estimate, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.07-1.86; P = .03). No significant difference was  observed in caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Interview score, 1.19 [95% CI, 0.16  to 2.23] vs 0.55 [95%, -0.44 to 1.54]; treatment effect estimate, 0.64; 95% CI,  -0.62 to 1.90; P = .32). Advance directive completion was higher under the  intervention (19 of 38 [50%] vs 6 of 31 [19%] among those without directives at  the beginning of the study; P = .008). There were no differences in other  outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: PC education for community neurologists and provision  of team-based PC via telehealth is feasible and may improve QOL and advance care  planning. Overall treatment effects were small and suggest opportunities to  improve both the intervention and implementation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03076671.</td>

      <td>Impaired microglial phagocytosis promotes seizure development.</td>
      <td>In the central nervous system, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2  (TREM2) is exclusively expressed by microglia and is critical for microglial  proliferation, migration, and phagocytosis. TREM2 plays an important role in  neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral  sclerosis. However, little is known about the role TREM2 plays in  epileptogenesis. To investigate this, we utilized TREM2 knockout (KO) mice  within the murine intra-amygdala kainic acid seizure model.  Electroencephalographic analysis, immunocytochemistry, and RNA sequencing  revealed that TREM2 deficiency significantly promoted seizure-induced pathology.  We found that TREM2 KO increased both acute status epilepticus and spontaneous  recurrent seizures characteristic of chronic focal epilepsy. Mechanistically,  phagocytic clearance of damaged neurons by microglia was impaired in TREM2 KO  mice and the reduced phagocytic capacity correlated with increased spontaneous  seizures. Analysis of human tissue from patients who underwent surgical  resection for drug resistant temporal lobe epilepsy also showed a negative  correlation between microglial phagocytic activity and focal to bilateral  tonic-clonic generalized seizure history. These results indicate that microglial  TREM2 and phagocytic activity may be important to epileptogenesis and the  progression of focal temporal lobe epilepsy.</td>

      <td>Quantum dots-based "chemical tongue" for the discrimination of short-length Aβ peptides.</td>
      <td>A "chemical tongue" is proposed based on thiomalic acid-capped quantum dots  (QDs) with signal enrichment provided by excitation-emission matrix (EEM)  fluorescence spectroscopy for the determination of close structural  analogs-short-length amyloid β (Aβ) peptides related to Alzheimer's disease.  Excellent discrimination is obtained by principal component analysis (PCA) for  seven derivatives: Aβ1-16, Aβ4-16, Aβ4-9, Aβ5-16, Aβ5-12, Aβ5-9, Aβ12-16.  Detection of Aβ4-16, Aβ4-16, and Aβ5-9 in binary and ternary mixtures performed  by QDs-based chemical tongue using partial least squares-discriminant analysis  (PLS-DA) provided perfect 100% accuracy for the two studied peptides (Aβ4-16 and  Aβ4-16), while for the third one (Aβ5-9) it was slightly lower (97.9%).  Successful detection of Aβ4-16 at 1 pmol/mL (1.6 ng/mL) suggests that the  detection limit of the proposed method for short-length Aβ peptides can span  nanomolar concentrations. This result is highly promising for the development of  simple and efficient methods for sequence recognition in short-length peptides  and better understanding of mechanisms at the QD-analyte interface.</td>

      <td>Alzheimer's Disease and Aging Association: Identification and Validation of Related Genes.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Aging is considered a key risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD).  This study aimed to identify and validate potential aging-related genes  associated with AD using bioinformatics analysis. METHODS: Datasets GSE36980 and GSE5281 were selected to screen differentially  expressed genes (DEGs), and the immune cell correlation analysis and GSEA  analysis of DEGs were performed. The intersection with senescence genes was  taken as differentially expressed senescence-related genes (DESRGs), and the  GSE44770 dataset was used for further validation. The potential biological  functions and signaling pathways were determined by GO and KEGG, and the hub  genes were identified by 12 algorithms in Cytohubba. The expression of 10 hub  genes in different brain regions was determined and single-cell sequencing  analysis was performed, and diagnostic genes were further screened by gene  expression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Finally, a  miRNA-gene network of diagnostic genes was constructed and targeted drug  prediction was performed. RESULTS: A total of 2137 DEGs were screened from the GSE36980 and GSE5281  datasets, and 278 SRGs were identified from the CellAge database. The  overlapping DEGs and SRGs constituted 29 DESRGs, including 14 senescence  suppressor genes and 15 senescence inducible genes. The top 10 hub genes,  including MDH1, CKB, PSMD14, SMARCA4, PEBP1, DDB2, ITPKB, ATF7IP, YAP1, and  EWSR1 were screened. Furthermore, four diagnostic genes were identified: PMSD14,  PEBP1, ITPKB, and ATF7IP. The ROC analysis showed that the respective area under  the curves (AUCs) of PMSD14, PEBP1, ITPKB, and ATF7IP were 0.732, 0.701, 0.747,  and 0.703 in the GSE36980 dataset and 0.870, 0.817, 0.902, and 0.834 in the  GSE5281 dataset. In the GSE44770 dataset, PMSD14 (AUC, 0.838) and ITPKB (AUC,  0.952) had very high diagnostic values in the early stage of AD. Finally, based  on these diagnostic genes, we found that the drug Abemaciclib is a targeted drug  for the treatment of age-related AD. Flutamide can aggravate aging-related AD. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that cellular SRGs might play an  important role in AD. PMSD14, PEBP1, ITPKB, and ATF7IP have the potential as  specific biomarkers for the early diagnosis of AD.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: Previous studies only focused on changes in the global age-specific  incidence and mortality for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, failed to  distinguish between cohort and period effects, and did not discuss risk factors  separately. METHODS: In this study, Alzheimer's disease disability-adjusted life years  (DALYs) data to estimate the burden by gender, age, locations, and  social-demographic status for 21 regions from 1990 to 2019. Additionally, trend  analysis was performed using the age-period-cohort (APC) model and Join-point  model. RESULTS: In most regions, indicators (incidence, mortality, and DALYs) increased  steadily with socio-demographic index(SDI) increased. The age effects for  Alzheimer's disease and other dementias showed a significant increase from 40 to  95 years. The cohort effects rate ratios (RRs) had a rapid reduction attributed  to smoking, high fasting plasma glucose, and high body mass index (BMI). CONCLUSIONS: Countries in middle-low and low SDI regions have higher levels of  risk factor exposure. As a result, rapid and effective government responses are  necessary to control dementia risk factors and reduce the disease burden in  these countries.</td>

This pathway seems to be the gateway  of protein aggregates, such as tau and α-synuclein, to the cytoplasm.  Furthermore, we and others reported that the amyloid precursor protein (APP) C99  is predominantly processed by γ-secretase in the endo-lysosomal compartments,  and β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides are enriched in the same subcellular loci. While the  role(s) of APP/Aβ in the endo-lysosomal pathway has not been fully established,  a recent study reported that Aβ, in particular Aβ42, inhibits cathepsin D (CTSD)  activity. Here, we show using a cell-free in vitro assay that Aβ42 also blocks  cathepsin B (CTSB) activity. Furthermore, we uncovered that the autocatalytic  processing (i.e., conversion of single chain to heavy/light chains) of CTSB and  CTSD is accelerated in APP-deficient cells compared with wild-type controls.  Taken together, our findings further support the negative regulation of  cathepsins by Aβ.</td>

      <td>Amyloid-β, tau pathology, and biomarkers of neurodegeneration make up the core  diagnostic biomarkers of Alzheimer disease (AD). However, these proteins  represent only a fraction of the complex biological processes underlying AD, and  individuals with other brain diseases in which AD pathology is a comorbidity  also test positive for these diagnostic biomarkers. More AD-specific early  diagnostic and disease staging biomarkers are needed. In this study, we  performed tandem mass tag proteomic analysis of paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)  and serum samples in a discovery cohort comprising 98 participants. Candidate  biomarkers were validated by parallel reaction monitoring-based targeted  proteomic assays in an independent multicenter cohort comprising 288  participants. We quantified 3,238 CSF and 1,702 serum proteins in the discovery  cohort, identifying 171 and 860 CSF proteins and 37 and 323 serum proteins as  potential early diagnostic and staging biomarkers, respectively. In the  validation cohort, 58 and 21 CSF proteins, as well as 12 and 18 serum proteins,  were verified as early diagnostic and staging biomarkers, respectively. Separate  19-protein CSF and an 8-protein serum biomarker panels were built by machine  learning to accurately classify mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD from  normal cognition with areas under the curve of 0.984 and 0.881, respectively.  The 19-protein CSF biomarker panel also effectively discriminated patients with  MCI due to AD from patients with other neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, we  identified 21 CSF and 18 serum stage-associated proteins reflecting AD stages.  Our findings provide a foundation for developing blood-based tests for AD  screening and staging in clinical practice.</td>

      <td>Plasma Biomarker Strategy for Selecting Patients With Alzheimer Disease for Antiamyloid Immunotherapies.</td>
      <td>IMPORTANCE: Antiamyloid immunotherapies against Alzheimer disease (AD) are  emerging. Scalable, cost-effective tools will be needed to identify amyloid β  (Aβ)-positive patients without an advanced stage of tau pathology who are most  likely to benefit from these therapies. Blood-based biomarkers might reduce the  need to use cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or positron emission tomography (PET) for  this. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate plasma biomarkers for identifying Aβ positivity and stage  of tau accumulation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The cohort study (BioFINDER-2) was a  prospective memory-clinic and population-based study. Participants with  cognitive concerns were recruited from 2017 to 2022 and divided into a training  set (80% of the data) and test set (20%). EXPOSURE: Baseline values for plasma phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181),  p-tau217, p-tau231, N-terminal tau, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and  neurofilament light chain. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Performance to classify participants by Aβ status  (defined by Aβ-PET or CSF Aβ42/40) and tau status (tau PET). Number of  hypothetically saved PET scans in a plasma biomarker-guided workflow. RESULTS: Of a total 912 participants, there were 499 males (54.7%) and 413  females (45.3%), and the mean (SD) age was 71.1 (8.49) years. Among the  biomarkers, plasma p-tau217 was most strongly associated with Aβ positivity  (test-set area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.94;  95% CI, 0.90-0.97). A 2-cut-point procedure was evaluated, where only  participants with ambiguous plasma p-tau217 values (17.1% of the participants in  the test set) underwent CSF or PET to assign definitive Aβ status. This  procedure had an overall sensitivity of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.90-0.98) and a  specificity of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.77-0.95). Next, plasma biomarkers were used to  differentiate low-intermediate vs high tau-PET load among Aβ-positive  participants. Plasma p-tau217 again performed best, with the test AUC = 0.92  (95% CI, 0.86-0.97), without significant improvement when adding any of the  other plasma biomarkers. At a false-negative rate less than 10%, the use of  plasma p-tau217 could avoid 56.9% of tau-PET scans needed to identify high tau  PET among Aβ-positive participants. The results were validated in an independent  cohort (n = 118). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that algorithms using plasma  p-tau217 can accurately identify most Aβ-positive individuals, including those  likely to have a high tau load who would require confirmatory tau-PET imaging.  Plasma p-tau217 measurements may substantially reduce the number of invasive and  costly confirmatory tests required to identify individuals who would likely  benefit from antiamyloid therapies.</td>

      <td>A Quantile-Quantile Toolbox for Reference Intervals.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Parametric statistical methods are generally better than  nonparametric, but require that data follow a known, usually normal,  distribution. One important application is finding reference limits and  detection limits. Parametric analyses yield better estimates and measures of  their uncertainty than nonparametric approaches, which rely solely on a few  extreme values. Some reference data follow normal distributions; some can be  transformed to normal; some are normal or transformable to normal apart from a  few extreme values; and detection and quantitation limits can lead to data  censoring. METHODS: A quantile-quantile (QQ) toolbox provides powerful general methodology  for all these settings. RESULTS: QQ methodology leads to a family of simple methods for finding optimal  power transformations, testing for normality before and after transformation,  estimating reference limits, and constructing confidence intervals. CONCLUSIONS: These parametric methods have a particular appeal to clinical  laboratorians because, while statistically rigorous, they do not require  specialized software or statistical expertise, but can be implemented even in  spreadsheets. We conclude with an exploration of reference values for amyloid  beta proteins associated with Alzheimer disease.</td>
