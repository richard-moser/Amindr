Cognitive-screening tests are used to detect pathological changes in mental 
abilities. Many use orally presented instructions and test items. Hence, hearing 
loss (HL), whose prevalence increases with age, may bias cognitive-test 
performance in the target population for the screening of dementia due to 
Alzheimer's disease. To study the effect of the auditory test format, an 
impairment-simulation approach was used in normal-hearing listeners to compare 
performance on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, a memory task employed in 
dementia screening and research, when test items were unprocessed and processed 
to simulate age-related HL. Immediate verbal recall declined with simulated HL, 
suggesting that auditory factors are confounding variables in cognitive 
assessment and result in the underestimation of cognitive functioning.
